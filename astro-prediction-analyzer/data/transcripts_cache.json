  "wSInpoN-xp4": "It's a matter of time before the next big crash. Now, I don't know when it is. Nobody else does either. What I do know is that it does feel like it's coming soon. One of my favorite quotes is, \"Everyone has a plan until they get hit in the mouth.\" As a Muay Thai fighter for years and now as a student of jiu-jitsu, this couldn't be more true. But for those of you that have not yet gone through a real market crash, I'd say one of those feels more like a kidney punch than just a punch to the face. In MMA or boxing, when you get hit in the kidney, it doesn't just hurt in the moment, it hurts for days and weeks after the fact. So, this video is going to give you real data of what to do in the event of an actual real crash and hopefully spur you to build out your plan today so that you can be proactive rather than reactive. I'll give you the only three scenarios that you can do in the event of a crash so you can be very ready. My name is Nolan Goa. My students call me Professor G, and I made this channel to make investing simplified. Remember that all investing carries risk, so do your own research. This is not financial advice, and I'm not a financial adviser. So, early last year in 2025, many people started to get worried because we had a new president start his term, and that president has some polarized views. We knew that we'd be in for an interesting year, but we didn't know exactly how interesting. And very quickly we found out when he announced the tariffs in February and then doubled down hard in March and very much in April. We can literally see what this did to emotional investors and institutions by just looking at the chart of what happened in the S&P 500 last year. February started the skid and it accelerated through April. The problem was that many people started selling just because what if? Thinking that these tariffs were the end of the world and what was going to happen was everything was going to shut down or the rest of the world was going to ban against us or this was just going to increase prices so bad that all margins were going to decrease and profit was going to go away and the whole United States market was just going to drop like crazy. I remember having conversations with people very high up in the finance world and they were saying that this one is totally different. We've never had anything like it and there's a possibility that we don't even have a stock market come 2026. All right, take it easy, Turbo. Don't get too carried away. People started selling and then more and more news kept coming that the rest of the world was going to increase their tariffs on us, making many even more nervous. Then more selling happened. Then when people saw massive sell-offs and declines of 10 to 15%, that caused even more selloffs. So now people were selling only because others were selling. So many people lost so much money, not because they sold probably in a loss right then. But even worse, if you look at the rest of the year, this market just accelerated right back up. So for anyone who sold in like April and then held their money out waiting for even more of a dip, they lost out on 25% or more of gains. had they bought in at the bottom and overall had they just done nothing all year, they would have gained around 18% just staying put. So, here's some more actual historical figures with data from actual long-term research after 10% corrections or pullbacks. The average 3-month return is at a positive 2.8%. The average six-month return is a positive 5.4%. The average one-year return is positive 5.2%. The average two return is plus 14%. And this is average returns going back to 1928. For deep declines of over 15% or greater, the average 12 month return post decline is about 47% historically. Now, these figures don't guarantee future returns, but it's just showing you actual historical data dating back all the way to the Great Depression time. And even deeper than that, here's what happens after specific dips. specifically looking at typical declines and recoveries. So corrections anywhere between a 10 to 20% decline are common and usually recover within a few months. Bare markets which are above a 20% decline take much longer. Historically around 19 months to bottom and recovery can take years. However, in many cases the market does eventually recover and reach new highs. During the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, the S&P 500 fell around 55% but later posted dramatic gains like 70% in the year following the March 2009. After the CO 19 crash in March 2020, the S&P 500 fell about 30% over weeks but rebounded to new highs within months. And we've seen even faster downturns and then even faster recoveries in the past couple of years. More specifically, the one that just happened last year had everybody going crazy. And within a couple of months, everything was back to normal and soaring to new all-time highs almost so much that when you really think about what happened in that March, April time, it was almost funny. Downturns are definitely painful in the moment. And I remember that in March and April, people were freaking out and it was a bit scary, but they rarely last for very long. And if you're invested in the right things, they come right back up every single time. So, the most important thing that you need to do is be able to plan out exactly what would you do if there was a bigger dip than normal, right? It's pretty easy to say that if there's a dip, I'll just buy the dip. But what if that dip lasts 2 or 3 years? And what if that means that it's going to cause job loss and there's going to be market slowdown and economic slowdown and all the while you're just trying to have your basic needs met? Well, there's three different scenarios that you should understand, and I'm going to highlight each one so that you can figure out what's best for you. But first, let me thank and introduce the sponsor of this video, Outskill, which is the first ever AI focused educational platform to accelerate AI learning.

First option, you could just sell. And honestly, this is called panic selling. But let me throw a quick caveat here. If it's a bad company or a very speculative company and it's dropping, there is a difference between that and maybe something like the S&P 500 or the total US stock market dropping because the whole economy is down for this period. If it's a bad stock, bad company, you probably shouldn't be in it anyway and it's quite speculative. It could go down and it could stay down. That doesn't mean it's coming back up. So selling out of that may actually be a smart move. What we're talking about though is investing in something broad-based that has much history that has solid data that's been around forever. And so anything that I'm talking about here in this section, it has to do with ETFs. Specifically, just think the S&P 500. So anyway, if there's a huge crash and you sell because it's scary, that's going to be a panic cell because a market drop only becomes a loss. You only lock in the loss if you sell. If it drops and you don't do anything or you don't sell it or whatever, yes, on paper your value has gone down, but as soon as it comes up within a couple months, maybe a couple of years if it's a bad one, then we're right back to the value that you had. You don't lose the shares. So, you only lose if you sell. And some people might say, well, I'm just going to sell now because if it drops further, then at least I save myself from those losses. Which, yes, that's true. But then I always ask them, okay, but then when do you buy in? and their answer is always, well, I'll just buy in when it hits the bottom. How do you know that it's the bottom? That's the whole point. Most people that sell, they actually lose out the most because it comes back up and they're saying, \"Well, I think it's going to come back up and well, it's probably going to drop a little bit more and then when it drops more, then I'll buy.\" But really, what happens is it just steadily starts increasing and then they just say, \"Well, I still want to be invested in the S&P 500. I know I should be forever, so I'll just buy in now.\" So now they sold at a low, they're buying at much higher. So they really lost out on a couple of different ways. So the number two scenario, if the whole market were to crash, what you could do there is nothing. So basically, you just hold through the dip. You let the market do what it's going to do and you weather the storm. I remember when I was in my MBA in one of my highle finance classes. I remember a story that I'll never forget and it was a study on who is the best investors over a period of time. I forget if it was a 30 year, 40-year study, something like that. And literally the best investors, the ones that did the absolute best or one of two things. Number one, they either forgot that they had that account and so they literally held through dips and things because they just didn't even remember that they had it. so they just held and let it go. Or number two, that person was dead. So literally, they had to hold it and they couldn't touch their accounts. Either way, the person didn't touch the accounts. And those were the investors that did the best through any market periods. Historically, markets recover and go on to new all-time highs even after severe downturns like 2008 and 2020. Meaning holding through often restores value. Data shows that missing just a few of the best market days can drastically reduce long-term returns. And the best rebound days often come near or just after the worst downturns. All right, so number one, you could either panic sell. Number two, you could just hold. Number three is my favorite, and it's tough to do, but if you have a plan, this is where you get very rich. And number three is just to buy the dip. The outcome here is that they're potentially higher returns, but it's definitely not guaranteed. After big declines, the average one-year return of the S&P 500 following a 20% draw down has been higher than usual, like closer to 10% versus under 7% long-term. Now, just so you know, it doesn't just mean that if you buy the dip, you're going to be good, right? For those of you that have actually done this before, let's just say in April, this actually happened. I actually did this. So, in February, the tariffs were announced and things started to drop. Then in March, they dropped harder. And when that second drop happened, I bought because at that point it was down, I forget 12%, something of that nature. And I thought this is a great time to throw a good amount of money in. Well, the problem was that it kept escalating and so it dropped even further down 20% or so. And so yes, my buy the dip then dipped further. So I saw my money lose for a second. What I did was I just bought more at that point. And yes, I understand that had the tariff conversation keep going or things escalated geopolitically, that dip could have even turned into a further dip. That absolutely can happen. But what I'm saying is I had a plan. I knew that if something drops about 10%, I'm good to throw a little bit more than my normal dollar cost average into it. If it drops more than 15%, I'm probably putting most of any of my reserves into the market. I've seen the data. I've seen the studies. We rarely see a 15% and definitely rarely see a 20% drop. So, the odds are in my favor. I knew that I could throw the money in and even if it took a year or two or three of a crazy, you know, slowdown recession, I would have been okay. Now, you have to assess your position because if you're retired or if you need the money next year or next month, it's not necessarily the best idea for you to be playing those odds. It'd be much better for you to set yourself up for safety. So, I understand a good amount of people that watch my videos are actually in retirement and trying to keep yourself safe. And so, I'm not talking to you. You're probably not buying the dip. You're probably setting yourself up for being able to do number two, which is just to hold through the dip. And the best way to actually set yourself up to do that is to do what I say in a lot of my videos, which is have about 3 years worth of living expenses off to the side. The average recession is anywhere between a year and a year and a half. And then really bad ones are closer to about three years. And so if you can be optimally safe with cash of three years off to the side and we have a terrible recession for three years, you can let your investments just stay and hold and do the best thing possible other than buying the dip and you can live off of the cash that's off to the side. And that right there is a perfect plan for you. So let me sum up the three options here and give you my final thoughts. If you sell on the dip, that often realizes losses and can miss strong rebounds. Historically, this is a poor decision for long-term returns. If you just hold, this captures much of the subsequent rebound on average, especially if you stick with it through recovery. And if you buy the dip, buying after a dip can boost returns over long-term periods. But timing matters, and sometimes dips can deepen before recovering. Market downturns just happen. For those of you that have been invested in the market for a long period of time, 20 years or more, you know that this is just a thing. And so we can't just sit here and say, \"Oh, I hope it never happens.\" Because it's going to happen and it's probably going to happen this year. So you need to build out your plan. And I would suggest that you build out the plan today. Have an idea of what you're going to do if you do see a dip and be proactive on it. Remember that last year, because I had a plan, and that's why I beat just sitting in the regular S&P 500 for the entire year last year. Had you just sat in the S&P 500 from the beginning of 2025 to the end of 2025, you would have earned around 18% or so. But because I bought so heavy in the dip, especially in March and April, my returns were about three times as much as that last year throughout my entire portfolio. And what am I investing in most this year? Click this video here that I just did where I go over my updated three fund portfolio. It's a very simple investing. Added a new ETF in there and give you all the percentages based off of your age and exactly how to do this. You can absolutely do this yourself. And remember to keep investing simplified.",
  "7x8_edpZNdM": "SO RELATIVELY FLAT WITH THE DOW INDUSTRIALS HIGHER BY JUST ABOUT A 10TH OF A PERCENT, S&P 500 DOWN A 10TH OF A PERCENT, AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE DOWN ABOUT ONE THIRD OF A PERCENT. JENNY, IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. SO WHEN WE'RE STARTING OFF WITH 2026, DO YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE WINNERS CONTINUE TO WIN? THE LOSERS CONTINUE TO LOSE. YOU HAVE THE NASDAQ THAT GAINED 20% IN 2025. BUT THE DOW JUST UP 13%. >> NO I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME REAL SHIFTS, SOME REAL BROADENING AND SOME REAL CHANGES IN THE NEW YEAR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT, I MEAN THAT NOT ONLY AT THE STOCK LEVEL, COURTNEY, BUT I MEAN THAT AT THE MARKET LEVEL, TOO. AND I'LL TELL YOU, LIKE, I'M SPOOKED. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M SPOOKED BY. I'M SPOOKED FROM A BEHAVIORAL PERSPECTIVE. THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN BLOOMBERG, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW IT A DAY OR TWO AGO. AND THIS IS THE HEADLINE. EVERY WALL STREET ANALYST NOW PREDICTS A STOCK RALLY IN 2026. NEVER IN MY 30 PLUS YEARS IN THIS BUSINESS HAVE I EVER SEEN PURE CONSENSUS PLAY OUT AS EXPECTED. SO THAT SPOOKS ME A LOT THAT EVERYBODY'S SO ON THE SAME PATH, YOU KNOW, AND YOU SEE, OH, WHAT'S MY BEST IDEA FOR NEXT YEAR? EVERYONE'S BEST IDEAS ARE MICROSOFT AMAZON, WHATEVER WORKS. THAT THAT DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME. AND I LOOK AT THIS AND I KEEP HEARING PEOPLE SAY, WELL, THE ECONOMIC DATA IS TERRIFIC, BUT THE ECONOMIC DATA WE HAVE IS BACKWARD LOOKING. AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE FAILING TO LOOK FORWARD STRONGLY ENOUGH INTO THIS NEW YEAR. THERE WAS THERE WAS A GUY NAMED SAL KHAN ON ON WEDNESDAY MORNING. DID YOU HEAR THAT? I DID, YEAH. AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS JOB APOCALYPSE. AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW THERE'S LIKE 5 TO 6 MILLION DRIVERS IN THE US. AND WE ALL KNOW WAYMO AND DRIVERLESS IS COMING. THAT'S REALLY BAD. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT LIKE CALL CENTERS IN WHERE WAS IT INDONESIA OR THE PHILIPPINES, WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO LAY OFF 80% OF THE PEOPLE. AND THEN EVEN THIS MORNING THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON ON WHO I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS. I WAS DRIVING, BUT THEY WERE SAYING THAT AI IS GOING TO ENABLE COMPANIES WITH 1000 EMPLOYEES TO TAKE OVER THINGS LIKE ACCENTURE, 100 EMPLOYEES TO TAKE OVER SAAS. I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE LABOR MARKET LOOKS LIKE GOING INTO THIS YEAR. AND YOU KEEP HEARING PEOPLE SAY, WELL, LABOR IS STILL STRONG, WAGE GROWTH IS STILL HIGH. BUT BUT THAT'S BACKWARD LOOKING. AND SO THIS SUPER ROSY OUTLOOK, COUPLED WITH ME SEEING THAT THE LABOR MARKET COULD BE TOUGH, AND KNOWING THAT OVER 60% OF GDP IS DRIVEN BY CONSUMPTION. LIKE WHAT IF PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS? WHAT IF THEY CAN'T CONSUME CONTINUE TO CONSUME? AT THIS RATE, I GET A LITTLE BIT SKETCHED OUT. SO WHERE I END UP FOR THIS YEAR IS I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE RISK OFF THE TABLE. WE'VE HAD THREE FABULOUS YEARS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M SUPER BEARISH. IT DOESN'T MEAN I THINK A MAJOR BEAR MARKET IS COMING. BUT IF YOU'VE HAD A GREAT YEAR, TAKE SOME RISK OFF THE TABLE. WHATEVER FORM THAT'S GOING TO COME TO YOU IN, MAYBE YOU WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OUT AND SWITCH STRATEGIES AND GO FROM SUPER HIGH GROWTH IN WHAT'S WORKED INTO SOMETHING THAT'S JUST A BETTER VALUATION. MAYBE YOU WANT TO PUT MORE INTO INTERNATIONAL, MAYBE YOU DO WANT TO ADD TO FIXED INCOME, BUT I THINK THAT THE PLAYBOOK FOR THIS YEAR IS GOING TO IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT WAS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD, AND EVERYONE SEEMS TO JUST BE RIDING THE SAME OLD TRAIN. >> VERY INTERESTING. TAKE A LITTLE RISK OFF THE TABLE. I MEAN, KEVIN, AS JENNY'S TALKING ABOUT THE JOB MARKET, CANACCORD GENUITY IS TALKING ABOUT THE CLOSING WEEKS OF 2025, GIVING A GIFT TO 2026, SAYING WE HAVE A SOLID ECONOMY WITH JUST ENOUGH LABOR MARKET WEAKNESS TO ENSURE ONGOING RATE CUTS. SO THEY'RE SORT OF HEARTENED BY MAYBE SOME OF THE LABOR MARKET WEAKNESS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT THE SETUP FOR 2026 WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BROADER ECONOMY AND MAYBE THE PICTURE FOR JOBS THAT JENNY BROUGHT UP, BUT ALSO WHAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AS AI TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD? >> YEAH, I LISTEN TO JENNY'S COMMENTS AND I THINK THEY HAVE A LOT OF VALUE. I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT WE'RE THERE YET. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT CONSENSUS, THAT'S THE SCARY PART BECAUSE I KIND OF LEAN INTO THAT AT THE MOMENT. BUT I THINK THE SETUP IS STILL WHAT WE'VE SEEN FOR 2025, MAYBE JUST NOT WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM THAT WE HAD. THE AI TRADE IS STILL REAL. IT'S STILL GROWING. EVEN IF IT'S GROWING MORE SLOWLY. WE WILL PROBABLY SEE AN INTEREST RATE CUT IN 2026, MAYBE TWO, BUT THAT'S NOT A RATE CUTTING CYCLE. AND LASTLY, THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND I KNOW IT'S BACKWARD LOOKING HAS BEEN DECENT. SO THE SETUP FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR AT LEAST I THINK IS A CONTINUATION OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN 2025. BUT WHAT I DO LIKE ABOUT JENNY'S COMMENTS AND WHERE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE, IS THAT THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO BE QUITE AS EASY. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY AI IN AN EARNINGS CALL AND EXPECT YOUR STOCK TO MOVE MARGINALLY, SUBSTANTIALLY, INCREDIBLY HIGHER. IT MIGHT NOT MOVE AT ALL. SO I THINK STOCK SELECTION WILL BE SUPER IMPORTANT SELECTIVITY. AND I THINK THAT REALLY LENDS ITSELF TO PROFESSIONAL AND ACTIVE MANAGEMENT. SO I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE FOR 2026. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT YEAR. AND I SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO'S ANTICIPATING VOLATILITY AND MAYBE A SLOW GRIND HIGHER. >> THAT'S INTERESTING. I MEAN, MALCOLM TWO, I THINK I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF THE STOCK ANALYSTS, EVEN IF JENNY IS SAYING MAYBE THEY'RE OVERLY BULLISH FOR HER LIKING WHEN EVERYBODY THINKS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE HIGHER FROM HERE AND WE KNOW WE HAVE THESE ELEVATED VALUATIONS, BUT I'M ALSO HEARING A LOT OF THEM TO KEVIN'S POINT, SAY, BUT STOCK PICKING IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE SELECTIVE. WHERE DO YOU SIT AS YOU'RE OPENING UP THE PLAYBOOK FOR YOUR STRATEGY FOR 2026? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, COURTNEY, I DON'T KNOW IF TODAY'S JENNY'S BIRTHDAY OR WHAT, BUT I'M ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT HER, TOO, BECAUSE ONE OF THE LAST TIMES I WAS ON WITH HER, SHE SAID SOMETHING THAT GOT MY ATTENTION AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW. I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY DETAILS ON HOW TRUE IT WAS AT THE MOMENT, BUT IT'S A THREAD I'VE BEEN PULLING EVER SINCE. IT'S BEEN A FEW WEEKS, BUT JENNY WAS SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT SEEMS AS IF THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR, THE RETAIL INVESTOR, IS RUNNING OUT OF CAPACITY TO SPEND, AND THEY'RE HAVING TO SELL OUT OF THINGS LIKE PALANTIR AND NVIDIA AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S BEEN GOING UP REALLY WELL UP UNTIL THE RIGHT FOR RETAIL INVESTORS FOR THE YEAR, JUST TO BE ABLE TO RAISE CASH TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND AT THE TIME, I WASN'T REALLY TOO SURE HOW TRUE THAT WAS. BUT WHAT I'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO IS BITCOIN. AND BECAUSE I THINK THAT BITCOIN IS THE BAROMETER ON WHERE THE RETAIL INVESTORS FEAR AND GREED INDEX REALLY IS, THE VIX IS FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR. GREAT JOB THERE. BUT I THINK BITCOIN IS A BETTER READ ON WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR FALLS AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SINCE ABOUT OCTOBER, AROUND THE TIME I THINK THE DATA CAME THROUGH THAT JENNY WAS LOOKING AT AND SAYING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BITCOIN SELLING THAT'S BEEN DONE BY LONG TERM HOLDERS. SO BLOOMBERG HAD A PIECE OUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY INTERESTING, WHERE SOMETHING LIKE $3 BILLION WORTH OF BITCOIN HOLDINGS THAT ARE LONG TERM HOLDINGS, THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL TOKENS, NOT THE ETFS, HAVE MADE THEIR WAY INTO CIRCULATION FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT WAS AT THE FASTEST PACE. THIS HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND SO I KNOW FROM THE CRYPTO COMMUNITY, YOUR BITCOIN HOLDINGS ARE USUALLY THE LAST THING THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE TO SELL, ESPECIALLY NOW IN A YEAR WHERE THE IRS IS ACTUALLY DOING A BETTER JOB OF TRACKING THE CAP GAINS ON THOSE THINGS. SO I THINK IT'S VERY TELLING THAT THOSE TYPES OF SECURITIES ARE MAKING THEIR WAY INTO CIRCULATION. THE SELLING IS HAPPENING THERE, AND MAYBE TO THE POINT THAT I THINK JENNY AND KEVIN HAVE BEEN MAKING, 2026 PROBABLY IS NOT GOING TO BE THE PARTY UP UNTIL THE RIGHT THE WAY THAT IT WAS THE LAST THREE YEARS. PROBABLY A GOOD TIME TO BE LOOKING AT DE-RISKING. >> MALCOLM. YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS? I WAS WHEN WE WERE ON TOGETHER, I SAID IT WAS MICROSTRATEGY THAT I WAS LOOKING AT, AND I'D BEEN WATCHING MICROSTRATEGY SINCE JULY. YEAH, BECAUSE I'D SEEN ALL THAT MONEY COME OUT. SO IT WAS EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE AT NOW, WHICH IS BITCOIN. AND TO ME, I WAS SAYING THAT DAY THAT WAS THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE THAT WAS CATCHING MY ATTENTION. I'M NOT ACTUALLY I'M NOT ACTUALLY THAT WORRIED ABOUT NVIDIA. I'M NOT THAT WORRIED ABOUT MICROSOFT OR META. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE VERY TELLING, BUT I THINK THAT MICROSTRATEGY DOES SHOW WHERE LIKE A HUGE BASE OF INVESTORS ARE AND THAT THEY ARE FEELING THE PINCH AND THAT THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF DOLLARS. AND SO WHEN I WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS MORE AND MORE IN THE COMING YEAR, I THINK THIS IS ALL GOING TO BE BE RIGHT IN OUR FACE. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK US WHAT YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE NEXT THING THAT'S GOING TO REALLY DERAIL THE MARKET? WHAT'S GOING TO CAUSE THE NEXT BLACK SWAN? I ALWAYS THINK IT'S A DUMB QUESTION, BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE A BLACK SWAN IF ANY OF US WERE LOOKING AT IT, BUT I DO THINK THAT THE BIGGEST RISK TO THE MARKET IS JUS",
  "EX2vJXW7zO8": "We have a lot to unpack when it comes to the stock market here on the day. We're going to go into the charts, but it's important that we cover the facts first so we understand what's actually moving this market. Because going into today, there was a large sense of, you know what, we're probably going to have tariffs implemented on the EU. We're almost going after all of our allies as far as what we're doing with trade. Whether it's fair or not, that's literally what's happening. And everything was hitting the market. However, today you're seeing a gamecher. You're seeing a twist. You're seeing a reversal. And it's because of specifically what Trump is saying. Now, I will say right now, Trump is basically just getting his foot out of his mouth. That's all that's really happened here on the day. Let's get to it. We have a lot to talk about cuz there's a lot of big stuff and a lot of big trades coming out. Now, the first thing to understand is what's going on right now. Markets opened a little bit cautiously. Now, it's worth mentioning Trump was already giving a speech like early on in the morning, and the first thing he says is there will not be no need for any type of military action in Greenland, which was positive. The market bounced, but then it rejected back down after basically the governments of Europe said they're not interested in giving Greenland to Trump and Trump said, \"Well, doesn't matter. We're still going to do it.\" Whatever that means. Okay. So, then you draw it back down. Supreme Court also going into Lisa Cook, which is very important. This is actually stabilizing the Fed whether you know it or not. And it was kind of overshadowed by news today. So, basically, uh, Kavanaaugh, which is actually the Supreme Court justice that Trump pushed to put in there, if you guys don't remember, it was very controversial. Anyways, he was the one that basically said, \"Look, you need to we need to keep Lisa Cook in there because if you don't keep Lisa Cook, it almost gets rid of all legitimacy that the Fed is disconnected and separate from the White House and the government, which is what you want to have a Fed independent.\" So, that was good. That was good news on the day as well. Then Trump responded true social that the framework of the future deal with NATO on Greenland reached. Now, very important. Is he talking out of his butt? Is he making this up? Entirely possible. Who knows? He could mention tariffs again in 2 weeks. I don't know. But I think what happened is is he got on the stage and he said he wasn't going to use military and the market went up and then dropped back down after everyone said they weren't going to be giving him Greenland. And then from there he was like I got to basically back out of this and say we have a deal that we're going to be working on. He said who Marco Rubio someone else is going to be working on that. And then you know the market obviously skyrocketed back up which will go into the chart but you can see here on spy give like a 15minute look. This is literally what happened. you were sitting on QQQ at your 100 MA again 608 you got back up and within I I want to say 30 minutes you were from 610 almost all the way back into 620 pretty pretty great now I will say you did get a dip back to the downside and we'll go into that here in a second but again pretty solid okay final close really nice rally S&P 500 you can see down here 1.6% 6%. Dow almost 800 points. Intel, which has earnings today, very big here in the after hours. I'm not going to be able to track that. I'll have a video posted for you later on Twitter if you follow there. But very big. And the Russell reaches an all-time high once again. Very, very strong. Wise is huge. February 1 tariff is gone. This shows Trump is responsive to market pressure. Taco, taco, taco. Trump always chickens out. Meaning when he starts to threaten something, it's a buy. That's why we were saying this entire time. No, I thought this might last a little bit longer, but you have to be looking for buying opportunities when you're getting these dips. You have to. Now, it's not for short-term, which short-term would have killed for us and done awesome, but I still want to say it's about protecting your capital and understanding the long game versus the short game. I like making money short-term, scalping, things like that. But I understand I make most if not majority of all my money in the long-term investing leaps and stock. Okay, very important to note that Bitcoin bouncing a little bit as well. Proves volatility cuts both ways, the down and the upside, which is good. Now, Intel coming out. This is going to be big. We'll get more of that information, more of what's happening there. Again, you get to hear in the after hours where Intel is. I made this graphic a little bit earlier. You're sitting at a nothing's really changed. So, again, no real shift there just yet. So, definitely still going to be tracking that. This is going to be pretty big because again, Intel about a year ago was irrelevant. Now the the government is basically backing it. The United States is connected to it. They're definitely growing rapidly. Okay. So the government support 30 billion cash for the chips. Exhaust bank's new investment. Nvidia's investment. This is everything that you want to see. You want to see Intel continue. I'll have that updated later on on Twitter. Make sure you're following cuz as always I'm always keeping you guys up to date on there. If you guys don't know, I'm posting videos two to three times a day on there around stocks, what I'm looking at, different setups. Today I gave you guys all the juice on Nvidia. Again, showing you the key levels. Once we got above um the 181 level there, again, you guys can literally just go back through the post. I try to post this, you know, as much as possible. Once you got over that, I said you're going into the 100 daily moving average to 184, which obviously went into that and then you rejected off that level back down. So, again, giving you the juice, do what you got to do. It is all there for you. Now, a little bit further. Headwinds to be watching as far as tailwinds. Now, headwinds, we're looking at number one, tariff threats. Seems like it's removed, but it could come back. Important to understand that. Very, very important. And it's also worth mentioning that China was kind of stepping in to make some new trade agreements with the EU. Kind of not good news. We'll see what happens. Earning season is starting. Next week is big. We'll go into all those earnings. I posted it in Discord earlier. I'll have more of that posting on Twitter as well later on today. Uh Fed uncertainty. This is the big one into next week. Um this is going to be big. I don't think we're cutting rates next week, but it's worth mentioning that we have like I think Microsoft and I I want to say Meta I want to say reports on FOMC day Wednesday. So, it's going to be just so much going on. So, we're going to be looking out for that. Lisa Cook is probably not getting fired, which was overall good, but we could still see what happens with the Fed and the uncertainty that's kind of relying there. Um, and again, rate cuts priced for June. That again, what I'm saying, no no cuts are coming. the the next cut is priced for June which will be your next Fed chair taking place which is really interesting. Okay, the technical side volatility still elevated VIX is still kind of high. We'll go into that in a sec. AI seems fine. Deutsche Bank 2026 will be the most difficult year yet for AI. Um again I could really care less about Deutscha Bank says because they've been wrong about the market for like 3 years now. Um go fact check that. Go look at all their statements around 2023 being bad. We're not going to recover. or we could still this is a bubble. Yeah, Deutschia Bank has been wrong for a while. Congratulations, you retards. Um, again, that's where you're at right now. Tailwinds for the This is good stuff. Again, massive one with tariffs. Hopefully, this continues. We can get the EU trade deal back in line. Again, that was suspended. Market resilience. Again, this is what you want to see. Bouncing back, holding your 100 day moving average. Earnings, earnings, earnings, very, very important. More of that going to be coming in. Fed rate cut. We're not going to get that right now, but if we do, could be good. I only to get one right now. I think June is more likely going into like quarter number two. Gonna tell you right now the breadth and ro rotation is improving. Now this is important. Now I'm going to go more into this with the overall charts but it's important that we understand what this means is your MAG 7 has been lagging. What is it? What what do I mean by that? Okay going into something like and and look we're looking at like the let's go to the 2hour like Apple Apple's getting destroyed. Okay. So despite and SPY was literally at all-time highs like a few days ago, right? So you have SPY at all-time highs, but Apple, which is one of your largest holdings, if not the largest holding in the S&P, is literally going straight down. You go to Microsoft, you're going straight, which I think these are great long I think Microsoft's a fantastic long-term buyer. I'm going to tell you right now, I'm at 444, but I mean, you still have a gap, but you could still could keep coming down. But this just goes in that statement of your mag seven names are your leaders, but right now they're not leading. you need them to turn around. Um Amazon, you know, getting crushed back down to your 100 MA. If you hold that, you look fine. We'll see. Uh but again, where you're at there. Uh Tesla's finding a little bit of a recovery here, but has been getting shot down as well. Um Netflix just had earnings. I think earnings were fantastic. Um again, down as well. Not even just from earnings, just, you know, just been going down. So again, important to understand where we're at. And I might be missing. Nvidia is kind of flat here. Nothing really going on there. Um you know, Google is your best performer of all. It's the the number one. and the meta is down as well. So, it's just worth mentioning that MAG7's been your leaders and if they continue to not find strength, I do think it's a pretty big sign of weakness in the market. However, if you're this is just a dip and you start seeing money rotate back in, it's a good sign because it shows that the health of the over overall economy. You know, if we go back, people were saying, \"Oh, we're in a bubble cuz it's just AI and it's just tech going up.\" But those bubble boys, like it's it's funny. They get real quiet when like their agenda isn't being filled. It's it's really funny. So like you'll notice people start to push agendas and they tell you this. I'm so right. I'm so right. I'm so right. But then when something doesn't go the way that they like want it to, they just get silent, right? They get silent because that's what people don't follow them. People don't they don't have a following or they don't actually have merit they say. They just talk talk talk. And people that talk typically are losers. You one very important thing I learned at a young age. My dad my dad told me this right way way way back. He probably doesn't even remember. You'll never meet someone that's hating on you, jealous of you, anything like that that's doing better than you. Food for thought. Think about that one. Right. AI momentum, again, really nice to see. Intel, we'll see what happens from this. Again, I think AI names, data centers, etc. look really good. Um, key events over the next one to two weeks. Intel earnings, PCE, which will be big. Um, Proctor Gamble, some other stuff tonight. G is actually a big company. And then next week, earnings, all that as you can see there as well. So again, take a picture, do what you got to do, you're welcome. All the updates are there for you again as always. So let's get to work here. Now, the first few things I got to go into the sponsors for you guys as well. So if you guys want to see what we're trading, how we're trading, and I'm going to keep you guys updated and show you the trade that we took on the day. Yesterday I talked about one of our losers. I thought it was an educational moment. We'll go into this here in a sec. Um, but again, you get to see all of our trades, what we're doing with futures, everything aligned here. Again, what do we say here on futures? As you can see, our key levels, our level up here, look at this. I want you to see this 25637. Go look at NASDAQ. Go look at this. Beautiful baby. Beautiful. Your wife might lie. Your kids might lie. But Tyler, his levels, they never lie. Perfect touch rejection right back down. Absolutely. Chef's kiss. You're welcome, boys. Beautiful. Um again, so you get the futures updates, everything in there. Scalp setups. Now, we took two of the same trade here on the day. The first one was this morning. So this morning, we went long on um QQQ. Okay. So, once we started breaking out over 615 here, I started going long. And then once we started breaking out, I was like, you're getting in here. You're moving well. I'm moving my stops to uh either trailing or to break even. Do what you want to do. This obviously ended up stopping out. As you can see here, you actually had, you know, bad news regarding uh what was happening in Greenland. You dumped down. Okay. Then what happened? You bounced back up here and I say, look, you get above 616.5, hammer long. You're going long. Probably going to go for the gaff in your 621. What happens? Bada bing, bada boom. You go straight up. Easy money sniper. We had a few other trades as well that were mentioned in voice chat. But again, it's all there for you. All the wins, etc. Money. Yay. But anyways, that's there for you. Now, if you also want to trade futures, see how I trade, etc. Um, I use take profit trader. I'm actually requesting another payout today. I'll post it later on. But again, it's my favorite platform. I think it's the best. You can take payouts every single day. Um, again, I think it's the best out there. Do what you got to do. Links down below. Code he for 40% off. Again, you're welcome. Twitter, as always, is there as well. Now, charts, charts, charts, spy. So, the big thing I'm watching here when it when we look at spy and QQQ, I'm going to use them without drawings here first. Number one is you're still kind of breaking down here. Okay. Now, again, a lot of people, you probably saw this on everyone. You saw probably if you have Twitter, you saw this on your timeline for sure. There's no way in hell you didn't see this. Okay. Everybody in their mom was drawing the deck. It's a wedge. It's the end. Uh maybe, sure, maybe. I don't know. Right. It didn't take a rocket scientist to make money on the downside. Just going to say anyways, whatever. What's concerning here for me is how this is moving right here. Okay, that is not a pretty picture. If SPY can get back over this, which I want to say, you have momentum. You're finding some buyers, you get back above some of these key levels, you look good. But SPY, you know, pretty nasty drop, kind of recovers up, doesn't fill a gap, and you kind of reject near that 690, 689 level. Don't love it. Okay, want to make that really, really, really clear. Okay. Now, for the most part, where you're at, I'm still looking for this gap fill. To be honest, it's towards 692. If you find buyers, you look good. On the downside, what you're really looking out for is you have a few little areas of support we talked about yesterday. Rotates all of this. Okay, your 100 MA, your one 674, and then you have a little bit of support here as well, like a little SR flip. As you can see there, a lot of support there. So, as we come down back into 677, I really don't love the shorts at all. Even though you have room to 100, I just say be careful. The same thing here on ES is kind of what we talked about as well. And I was talking to Discord about this a lot, too. If you're playing futures, ES is just sitting on the 100 day moving average. That's not a short opportunity. You're just sitting on support. Now, if you were to flip this, okay, you were to flip this and start holding below and you so, you know, going to an example. Let's say, let's use this as an example, right? You kind of break down, you sit there, and you eventually get back above. But what you'd be looking at here for an example to go short and use this for spy is you come into it, you come up and you're looking for that rejection. So once you start rejecting off that level, you start getting into those positions and then ideally you break below a low and then break down there. That's what you want to see. That's what ideally is like a confirmation of that type of trade and how I'd be looking for a function like that. So important to know that if you have any questions, links or you know questions, I recommend Twitter. There's a lot of bots on Twitter. I I don't know what to do about it. Um, but yeah, I ban them when I can, just like I ban them here, but just keep coming back. So, equity stocks, what am I looking at? Number one, um, Netflix. I mean, I've been mentioning Netflix a lot. I've mentioned it non-stop on Twitter. Um, I know for a fact we've had this level here marked out forever. $82. You came right into it. I mean, picture perfect into our level this morning. Amen, brother. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh, right into our level, bouncing off it. If you didn't watch my video yesterday, last night, I think Netflix had phenomenal earnings. Phenomenal. Okay. Love it. I love where it's at. Very strong. I I I think they're going to go up. Okay. Warner Brothers just takes them over the top. Um longterm. If you break below 82 though, I'm looking down towards 7271. Just a heads up. That's my next big level. Keep your head on a swivel. What are we looking at there? Okay. It's a longterm name. Just letting you know. Now, the rest of the market, Nvidia, start here. And again, I could probably clean this chart up a little bit, but I love the levels, especially for Twitter. You're closing the day below uh 184 and your 100 MA. I don't love that at all. Not a good close. If you stay below the 100 MA, I'm looking back down towards 181. And it's really important to understand the way that you're moving in between these spots. Okay? What I mean, the spots, right? your resistance up here, your support down here. You're moving in these areas like it's cutting through butter up, down, up, down, which is great because you can take those trades. Meaning, you can go short, quick, fast move to the downside. You don't get a fast move, you start chopping here, you get out of the trade because it might chop back to the upside. Same thing down here. You break back above, right? Go long, take it back to the up. It just it makes sense. It's easy into the 100 MA. But just be careful. Where I get bullish is back above 184. Above 184, looking towards 187. I'm a big fan. I like what you're doing there. Still haven't filled the gap. So solid. But above 184 is where you look to go long. Can't go long until then. AMD. Don't know what's going on here. Actually, I do. I'm so sorry. So yesterday, and I missed I I knew the news yesterday. I read it like first thing in the morning at like 6:00 a.m. And then like when the trading session started, I just forgot like an idiot. Okay, so Meta said they're going to take a step back from Google's TPUs potentially, and they're going to use AMD to make some of their own in-house chips. Okay, AMD is obviously killing from this because they're working with a few companies now doing this. Okay, it's an alternative to Nvidia. So, above 242 today, you broke above that and you went crazy. Shout out to Jordan in Discord. Jordan also first day back, he mentioned this in live voice chat above 242. This thing literally ran straight into 250. It was monstrous, monstrous run. So again, AMB is cooking and semis are still cooking as well. SMH really nice recovery here on the day. Um yeah, pretty impressive. Almost back into alltime highs, which is crazy how you recover here. And it just shows you the dominance. And it's worth mentioning even though semis like look like they were potentially taking a turn right for the downside. You're still, and this is why you have to be like transparent, honest with yourself, you're still just in that channel. Higher lows, higher highs. Definition of a bull trend. Now, again, could this end? Could we drop back down tomorrow? Could bad news come out tomorrow? 100%. But again, it's just important to know where you're at and how you're moving. Okay. Um, another big name out there is Tesla. Got a nice bounce. Fill the gap. I would be watching Tesla here like a hawk. A hawk back below, not hawk toa. Pause. Okay. Back below the 100 in May. I I love it. You haven't come back down to 414. You're still really weak in my opinion. And if you go to the, you know, take away the drawings here, potentially putting in a higher low, I just don't like it. I'm not a fan. I don't like it at all. If there's any name in the Maxima that's overvalued, it's Tesla. Just saying. Everyone wants to point overvalued names. Tesla is that guy. Anyways, if you have any questions, let me know. Again, lots of content on Twitter. Make sure you're there. Discord link down below. Have a good one, traders. See you next video.",
  "6f-dbm719Cw": "In 2025, the S&P 500 had a total return very close to 18%. In 2024, the total return was 25%. In 2023, the total return was over 26%. That is massive, massive growth. And investors just need to pay attention because this is not normal. Today's January 3rd, 2026, and it's the first market news update video that I'm going to do for this year. So, happy new year. What if I told you that 2026 could be one of the most misunderstood years in the history of the stock market? Not a massive bull run and not a catastrophic crash, but a year where a lot of investors get shaken out while disciplined investors quietly win. Today, I'm breaking down the three biggest risks that could hurt investors in 2026 and three major opportunities that could reward long-term ETF and index fund investors. I'm also going to give you a list of key dates for you to put on your calendar because this January is the time where we can shape the entire stock market. My name is Nolan Goa. My students call me Professor G, and I made this channel to make investing simplified. Remember that all investing carries risk, so do your own research. This is not financial advice, and I'm not a financial adviser. All right. So, starting with those dates to watch out for, January is going to be where we decide whether growth or inflation or rates are going to matter most for the entire year. So, let's start with inflation because that's the highest volatility risk. January 13th through the 15th, we got the CPI inflation report, the PPI inflation report, and some important export prices. All of these are going to signal what might happen in the financial markets in the very near future. Then January 7th and January 9th, we have labor market information. We're basically looking at the jobs reports in general, but also labor demand, wage pressure, and this is going to be a major driver of stocks, bonds, and the Fed policy. Throughout the month, there's going to be different economic growth indicators as seen here. The one that I'm looking forward to the most is actually January 22nd, which is that Q4 GDP. This is going to be a broad economic growth outlook. But all of these are going to be so important, especially with the Fed rate meeting coming at the end of the month. And speaking of that, the Federal Reserve and Policy FOMC meeting and rate decision is January 27th and 28th. So definitely mark those on the calendar. This is going to set the tone for markets and rate expectations for the year. Depending on what we see there, we can start to forecast a little bit at least in the short term. A lot of people believe that we are going to see another rate cut and that small rate cuts will continue throughout the year. But it wouldn't surprise me if they pause this. The worst thing that could happen there though is if they not only pause it, but say pause indefinitely or that we have a possibility of rate hikes. That's going to mess with the market. I'm going to keep you updated every step of the way. And on these Saturday videos, this is where I give you the news from the past week and what might shape markets coming up. So now on to the biggest three risks for investors in 2026 and the three opportunities that I'm looking at very very closely. Biggest risk for 2026 and this first one is the most obvious and this is valuations. A large portion of the S&P 500's gains over the past few years has come from a small group of mega cap tech companies, many tied to AI. And don't get me wrong, these are great businesses. But here's the risk. When expectations get too high, even good news isn't enough. If earnings growth slows slightly, if margins don't expand as fast as investors expect, you don't need bad news for prices to fall. You just need less than perfect news. This doesn't necessarily mean a crash. It means lower forward returns and more volatility. set a different way. If your portfolio is mostly in growth like the NASDAQ 100 or SCHG or VUG or some of these sector specific AI style ETFs or individual holdings, 2026 could feel frustrating even if they continue to grow. These things are priced for perfection. They have to keep outdoing themselves each and every earnings report. And I don't care what company you are, that just doesn't happen every single time. Some people laugh when I say that we need to possibly have some value in the portfolio, not just all high-risk technology because they think that I'm saying that technology isn't going to be something 5 years from now or 10 years from now. I absolutely think technology is going to be an amazing piece of the portfolio. I'm just saying that this year from all the last couple of years where expectations were so high and hype has gone crazy and we've been growing like absolutely mad, at some point the rubber has to meet the road and the valuation has to meet the actual value and there's going to be a stall period and I just wouldn't be surprised if that was this year. But risk number two has to do with the interest rates because the market spent a lot of time over this last year really assuming that rates are going to fall and they're going to fall rapidly. But what if they don't? Things like sticky inflation, wage growth, and commodity spikes could keep the real interest rates elevated for a lot longer than us investors expect. And why does that matter? Because higher rates compress valuations, they increase borrowing costs. They hurt real estate and leveraged companies. And they reduce the appeal of long duration growth stocks. Even rates that just stay at this level or stay higher for a longer period than people are expecting could definitely create headwinds, especially for those assets that are priced for perfection and they need to grow each and every earnings report. Markets don't need the rates to even hike to be catastrophic. They just need the rates to stay where they are and not see rate cuts for us to see somewhat of a delay in the stock market. Which is why the end of January is so important. like I was talking about from before. Risk number three is just the geopolitical climate that we're in and price volatility. There's trade tensions, military conflicts, election uncertainty, and supply chain disruption. All of these can definitely trigger some short-term sell-offs. And we've seen that multiple times in 2025. And people are just ready. They're sitting on the edge of their seat to do that again here in 2026. If we see anything that starts to go ary, the real danger isn't necessarily even the event itself or the news itself, it's all the emotional investors that are going to make emotional decisions and get out of something way too quickly, which is going to cause a selloff and a mass selloff. All right, enough of the risk and the doom stuff. Let's talk about some happy things. Let's talk about the opportunities that we could see from 2026. But first, thank you to Cra.ai for sponsoring this video. As a business owner, there's so many tasks to be working on in the business, but working on the business and learning insights is arguably the most important. Cra.ai uses advanced artificial intelligent assistants designed to handle tasks just like a human team member, like Vizzy, the virtual assistant, Buddy, the business strategist, or Soshi, the social media manager. I personally use Dexter, the data analyst, to analyze insights for my YouTube channel and for the multiple businesses I run. And the insights gave amazing data. Dexter can do things like calculate the ROI for investing in new technology, provide a sales forecast, and generate tough financial statements. Cure.ai really makes it like you have a full team of individualized experts. And now here in 2026, you can really build and grow that business that you've always known you're capable of. They literally learn your business just like real employees and give you insights quickly to help you grow in many ways you never have thought of. I personally love that it integrates so easily with all the tools I already use like social media, Gmail, and my calendar. Go down to the link down in my description at cintra.ai/investingimplified or use code investing to get an exclusive 72% off all plans and there's a 14-day money back guarantee. All right, so let's talk about the opportunities that we could see from 2026. It's equally important to make sure we see some bad news and some good news. If all you're ever watching is things on good news or an echo chamber of what you want to hear, you should be very, very worried. Whenever I do research, I make sure and look at all sides and then I make my decision based off what I'm seeing. All right, enough of the professor voice. Let me take my professor hat off for a second. Let's just go straight to opportunities. So, opportunity number one, what if AI actually does do what everybody's been hoping that it's going to do? AI from 2023 to 2025 was all about hype and excitement, but 2026 is about execution at this point. Up until this point, it's been like, \"Oh, AI is this cool tool and this cool technology that's going to change everything. What if that happens?\" Well, we're kind of here now. Companies have been spending billions and billions of dollars to build out this infrastructure and to totally change the way they do things. And at this point, investors are sitting here like, \"Okay, did it do what it's supposed to do?\" We have to start seeing some revenue increase or some major expenses decrease. We have to see some ROI and we have to start seeing that now. And we have to remember that AI isn't just about tech stocks. It's literally being integrated into all the things that we invest in. It impacts productivity, operating margins of pretty much every company, software efficiency, logistics, health care, and finance. Overall, investing in AI, I always like to tell people that the best way to do so is through a broad ETF. And it doesn't necessarily need to just be AIcentric, and I actually don't recommend it being AIcentric. I like just broad in general, higher technology. But like I said, AI is a tool that a bunch of companies are going to be using. So you don't need to invest just in AI itself to actually get the benefit of this AI thing. This is where broad tech ETFs and diversified growth strategies can benefit without betting on a single winner. I really like VGT for overall technology. AIQ if you really do want to center it all around AI. DTCR is a cool ETF specifically around energy and data centers and what's actually going to be needed because of all this new AI. But then I always love to just come back to the triedand-true broad growth ETF like QQQM, SCHG or VUG. I would pick one of these three over all the rest of them because of the broad growth that it gives and because long-term I believe those are such a good staple for the portfolio overall. Okay. Opportunity number two, and this one's actually going to be the opposite of one of the risks, and this is all about the rate cuts. Like, what if we see actual rate cuts consistently for a period of time, and we actually see by maybe the middle of the year, maybe by the Q3, Q4 of the end of this year, that the rates have gone down substantially. Historically, lower rates help small cap stocks, cyclical sectors, real estate, and just business investment in general. The main thing here is that we don't need anything aggressive. We don't need to see the rates fall super super quick in one fell swoop. But if we do see a cut almost every single time that they can cut, then what that starts to produce is clarity. And I've been saying this since the beginning of last year when the tariffs were first announced and when we were supposed to start seeing the Fed rate get cut and we didn't and then things got pushed back. The whole problem with the stock market wasn't any one event. It was just uncertainty and not knowing exactly what the heck we were even doing. So with these rate cuts coming and being able to be forecasted and seeing consistency, what that gives is clarity and then we can invest smart. So again, I know I've said this a couple times, but the end of January at that next Fed meeting is one of the biggest events that we're going to see for the entire year because it sets the tone. And now opportunity number three, and this is all about dividend growth and quality or even value. In volatile or slower growth environment, boring investing usually wins. Companies with strong balance sheets, consistent cash flow, growing dividends tend to outperform on a riskadjusted basis. And what I'm talking about here is true value. It's true companies with true dividend growth, not just a company that has like a 10% dividend or an ETF that has a 15% dividend. That's not the same thing. Usually, those are actually pretty high risk and they're doing some type of a strategy like covered call or something of that nature. I'm talking about actual solid companies that have been raising their dividends for the past 50 years. not just having a dividend for 50 years, but raising it every single year. That's the type of company that you want to be invested in right now. And so, this is a list called the dividend kings. And every single one of these stocks, you can look it up after this. Every one of these stocks has a dividend growth every single year for the past 50 years or more. or even simpler would just be to invest in SCHD, which is one of the best ETFs that I think there is out there for specifically dividend growth. Look at this dividend growth here. And the main thing is that you get to invest in just one thing. You buy this one ETF. It has a bunch of companies that all fit into what I just talked about with strong balance sheets, consistent cash flow, most importantly, growing dividends. So even if the market stalls out, these companies have shown that even through any bad years, because if they've been growing their dividends for over 20 years, 30, 40, 50 years, that means they've gone through market cycles where the market was down big time, and they still grew their dividend. So CHD is definitely one of my favorites. But for long-term investors, this can be a powerful anchor in uncertain years. This is why I've been so heavy on making sure you stick with boring ETFs like SHD or VM or VTV and keeping value a big part of the portfolio. 2026 for sure is not going to be easy, but it doesn't need to be scary. The investors that are going to struggle are going to be the ones that chase the headlines, overreact to volatility, and try to time each and every move. The investors who win are going to be the ones that stay invested. They rebalanced early. They diversify and they focus on long-term compounding. I recommend that you take a little bit of time and watch this video here because it's literally everything that I've learned in the past almost 20 years of doing this investing and finance thing and especially now at the beginning of 2026 with a very interesting market we're about to see. This could be very beneficial for your investing. Remember to keep investing simplified.",
  "1HbbszQUW84": "2026 is going to be a tough year for the world economy. And in this video, I'm going to be taking you through my top 10 key, specific, and unique financial astrology predictions for the global markets in the year ahead. My name's Rowan. I'm a financial astrologer who uses the tropical western zodiac alongside traditional Vadic techniques to analyze stocks, cryptos, and macroeconomic events to give you an advantage in your finances by showing you a unique perspective which is one step ahead of the markets. Here I'm going to summarize my research so far and give you 10 key and unique predictions for the macroeconomic financial situation in the world using financial astrology techniques. So let's just get straight into it because 2026 is going to be a very interesting year. Prediction number one, the great crypto reset. I believe that 2026 is going to be a very tough year on cryptos, on Bitcoin, on Ethereum, on altcoins and for tech stocks in general. We're entering a firehorse year and Bitcoin being born in early 2009 is an earth rat. In Chinese astrology, these two signs create a massive clash towards each other. They they do not get on well energetically. And we can verify this because if you take a look at the last horse year for Bitcoin, that was 2014, which was a year where we saw one of Bitcoin's biggest bare markets. We're entering another horse year in 2026 starting around February. And I believe that this is one reason amongst many why we're going to see Bitcoin get crushed. Second reason here is because if we use the traditional western chart for the 3rd of January 2009 at quarter 6 in London, UK which is a very responsive astrological chart for Bitcoin around March we do see that transiting Saturn which is debilitated in Aries will be making an exact conjunction over Bitcoin's natal moon. Now Saturn represents negativity, restriction, depression, and the moon represents the emotional market sentiment surrounding this asset. So I believe that from around March, there's going to be some really visible depressing sentiment around Bitcoin, which will start a bare market year in 2026 for Bitcoin. And thirdly, if we use the hellistic technique of perfection years, we assign one house per year. Bitcoin is entering what we call a sixth house perfection year. Themes of the sixth house include struggle, obstacles, health issues, daily grind. It's a very obstacle ridden house. It's to do with health issues, with debt, with grinding burdens. So, it's not a very bullish year. And if we actually go back 12 years to the last sixth house perfection year, it was also 2014, another horse year again where we saw this massive draw down in terms of Bitcoin. I've also checked the varala chart. This is the Vadic solar return chart which is presenting a very bearish, not very positive yearly result for Bitcoin. So, I think 2026 is going to be a really bad year for Bitcoin. I think we could see some excellent buying opportunities if you're still interested by around quarter 3, 2026. And we'll get into reasons why in my later predictions. Prediction number two, the February Federal Reserve crisis. I believe astrologically that the Federal Reserve is going to come into a major crisis around February 17th. Give it a week before, give it a week after, midFebruary 2026. We're going to see a major crisis with the Federal Reserve. And if there's a naturally if there's a crisis affecting the Federal Reserve, it's affecting the US economy. And if it's affecting the US economy, it's likely affecting many other economies around the world. The reason for this is we have this Saturn Neptune conjunction going over the midheaven angle of the Federal Reserve. when you use a specific chart for the Federal Reserve. Now, the midheaven point is the angle which is related to public visibility, to career, and to reputation and status. And when Saturn and Neptune conjoin at 0° Aries, right on this midheaven angle, this is going to bring a kind of major crisis of confusion. It'll be stressful in the Federal Reserve around this time. We will likely see media stories related to the Fed having a crisis of sort around midFebruary, late February. Now Saturn is a planet of restriction, deflation, contraction and Neptune is often associated with inflation. So is there some sort of crisis in which the two can't go away? You know, there's a inflationary crisis in which the solution is massive deflation or is there a deflationary crisis in which the uh solution is massive inflation. I think there's going to be a real stress around the Federal Reserve at this time, especially relating to the value of the dollar, the inflation, the deflation mechanics. So February, I think we're going to see a crisis at the Federal Reserve, which will have major knock-on effects for the world markets. Prediction number three, commodities will be the winning asset of 2026. So 2026, we're obviously anticipating to be very bearish for Bitcoin, crypto, altcoins, all of those kind of techy, fancy assets. And what we're already seeing is that we're having a major resurgence in the value of commodities. That's things like gold, silver, platinum, copper, uranium. I think the commodities are the winning asset class of 2026. I think they'll far outperform any tech stocks and crypto on the whole and I believe that silver is in fact the winner, one of the main winners of 2026. If you want to go deeper into the reasons why I'm predicting that silver will be a key asset in 2026, you can check out this in-depth interview I did with Sulab Jane of Chariot Palistry. He's a fantastic financial astrologer. We go into over half an hour's worth of deep discussion both from a vadic sedurial perspective and tropical western perspective and really fire off some key ideas in a timeline for silver through 2026. So I'd recommend you check that one out. What I will say here is that I can see silver having a major resurgence not only as a traditional safe haven asset but actually rediscovering its value in industry in this new technological revolution that we're going through. We're going to see silver in new batteries, in AI data centers, in a lot of the AI tech. Silver will be rediscovering its value both as a safe haven asset and as its practical use in industry. Prediction number four, we're going to have a regional American banking crisis around July 2026, specifically the second half of July 2026. This is based on a sonotic cycle of Pluto and Jupiter. We saw a conjunction in 2020 around April around the co crash. The waxing square of this aspect brought us the issues with first republic bank with republic first bank with credit swiss. You remember we saw all of those banking issues which felt like they were kind of swept under the rug a little bit. Now I think there's a major uh economic consequence coming in July 2026. I think American regional banks in particular are at risk around July uh around late July 2026. I'm quite confident we'll see some stories about bank failures, especially American regional banks, but perhaps UK and European banks as well around July 2026. This is when the opposition aspect goes, which is just another chapter in the story of the sonotic cycle between Pluto and Jupiter. So if you're into your banking stocks or if you're invested in banks, I would be very very cautious around July 2026. Prediction number five, this is quite an interesting one which I don't hear from anyone else online. Not so stable coins. These are these tokens which are backed by companies with basically a promisary note that we have the dollar value backing all of the tokens that we digitally make. Popular ones are USDC and USDT. I actually took a look at the astrology of tether USDT and I think that this could actually have a volatile year. I actually think we could see some risks of stable coin dep pegging. Now what is that? That is when a stable coin which claims it is worth $1 could actually dep 93 because I think there will be some auditing into these companies. Too many people in the crypto space blindly believe that Tether, the USDT and USDC that these companies are telling the truth basically. So I think there will be more auditing of companies and I think because of this massive bare market in crypto all this emotional fear will sweep the market and it will cause doubts uh especially in terms of the regulators and in terms of the auditors even in terms of just consumers who are using these stable coins. people will be in major fear in this crypto bare market and they'll be saying, \"Well, is is my stable coin safe? If I take my crypto money and I park it in a stable coin, how do I know that's safe?\" Well, the truth is you don't. And I think we there's a potential for a deping here with some stable coin companies. The practical advice for this is if you're taking money out of your crypto at any time, don't park it in stable coins because again, you're you're presuming that that value is fixed when it could actually slide and there could actually be some issues. So, it might not be a super dangerous uh event if it does come true. I do think we'll have news stories related to stable coin companies uh not being as uh solid and safe as we once thought. Prediction number six, the first of the AI bubbles will occur. Now obviously the major narrative right now is that there is a AI bubble, one AI bubble which is going to burst at some point. Now 2026 is a very bad year economically and again with the Saturn Neptune conjunction. This is one of 2026's peak timing windows for where I could see that happening. Saturn and Neptune, Saturn is restriction, negativity and cold hard truth. Neptune is over opt, you know, over optimism. It's inflation. It's bubbles. So when Saturn and Neptune conjoin, it gives me this archetypal imagery of Saturn bursting bubbles. Saturn and Neptune is a bubble bursting message. It's a bubble bursting archetype. And I particularly noticed that this is impacting the chart of Nvidia because Aries where the Saturn and Neptune conjunction is taking place is right on the second house of money and everyday resources for Nvidia. So I think the most likely window for this is February. Not only because we have the Saturn Neptune conjunction, but because we have a solar eclipse in the sign of Aquarius, which rules all of these tech stocks. I think the major window in 2026 for a tech stock, an AI bubble burst, is around late February into March. I think there could be multiple AI bubbles. It is likely the case because the narrative presumes that there is just one AI bubble, but I think for 2026, the most likely window for this to take place would be mid to late February. So again, if you're in tech stocks, AI stocks, crypto, that kind of stuff is really at risk in my humble opinion. Prediction seven, Ethereum will start to enter a long-term decline. Now, the reason for this is when you look at the Ethereum chart, it starts to enter a 12th house perfection year in late July 2026. This is when it goes from an 11th house year, which is more apicious, to a 12th house year. Now this is a less auspicious one of the least auspicious perfection years that you can get. 12th house years are loss, dispersion, uh reduction of energy, death, um basically the antithesis of growth. Now I'm not just basing this on the perfection year because I've noticed that Ethereum it's uh getting more costly. the gas fees associated with using the Ethereum network are are getting more costly even when there's updates coming out when there's uh the proof of stake when the merge happened I think Ethereum is at risk from competition from faster cheaper more efficient blockchains such as Salana Avalanche and especially Hideera Hashgraph now you'll see a macro narrative emerging that Ethereum is starting to be used in the mainstream financial sectors and we could indeed see some price rises for Ethereum but I think because it's such a harsh year on crypto uh in 2026, I think Ethereum will start to enter decline because the market will just simply reward faster, more efficient technologies like Avalanche, like Salana, and especially Hideera Hashgraph, which I'm a big fan of. So, I don't think Ethereum is sticking around in the long term. And I think the second half of 2026 is when we start to see this visible decline for Ethereum because this competition space is always evolving. The technology is always evolving and faster, cheaper, more efficient technologies already exist to replace Ethereum. Prediction 8. This is one that you might not have heard from any other uh people in the sort of prediction space. August uh 2026 presents a real risk of a health scare, a potential small virus. Nothing on the scale of COVID, but I think there will be a health scare regional outbreaks of something like a swine flu or a bird flu similar to 2008, 2009. Um, I think this isn't a massive pandemic, but I think um, pandemic PTSD kicks in for the markets, and we could see some real like market jitters and panics. I think we're going to see news break around early August 2026 that there's a a swine flu, a bird flu, some sort of virus. Maybe it's spreading regionally in China or spreading regionally in Europe. I think this isn't a pandemic that we have to worry about too much, but I think markets are going to severely overreact until they get more information. So, the first 3 weeks of August, we could expect to see a massive contraction in the markets purely based on the fear of this potential new virus. So, uh it might be good if you have um stocks that you've got your eye on that you want to invest around late July, especially after the banking crisis has happened, there's uh less confidence in the market. If we see any news related to virus around first three weeks of August that could be a good time to buy some stocks or assets on the cheap. So this is based on the uh transit of Jupiter in Ashia and Ja nakshhatras. This is a vadic astrology technique. a really interesting uh piece of research because you wouldn't associate Jupiter with bringing pandemics but I've done the back testing research and there's some strong correlation between Jupiter entering ashia and ja nakshhatras and these health scares arriving so I think we could see early news um of this by first week of August market panic sets in by the second or third week of August 2026 um so don't worry too much about that I don't think it's co um but might be a good time to take advantage of fear in the markets. Prediction nine, I think Tesla is going to be a particularly good stock in 2026. Now, I know Tesla's a bit of a, you know, it's just, you know, everyone likes Tesla. It's a bit of a meme. It's just a very well-known stock, but I think 2026 is going to have some good performance for Tesla, especially around the Saturn Neptune conjunction and Aquarius eclipse of February. This is when I think we're going to see the roll out of the Optimus robots. Now, these are Optimus robots. There is a little bit of hype related to this. there is a little bit of like oh well it's just overly hyped up new technology but I think we're going to see the roll out of these Tesla Optimus robots begin around February and I think we're going to see a price surge for Tesla stock especially around the second half of 2026 uh if you use a certain astrological chart for the first trade of Tesla we'll see Jupiter enters the first house of that chart by July 2026 and this is a generally apicious and strong transit for Tesla stock so I think we're going to a lot of revenue increase and a lot of stock price growth from Tesla specifically with the Optimus robots which will have farreaching consequences for the economy in the future. And prediction 10, real estate won't crash. In fact, it will just continue to increase. House values are going to continue to increase. I'm primarily predicting this for the western economy, UK, Canada, US, Europe to some extent. Western economy, housing market will continue to increase in value. Main astrological reason for this is that tropically Jupiter remains in the sign of cancer. This is a planet of expansion in a sign associated with homes with rentals with private spaces with the whole real estate sector as a whole. Also we have Jupiter coming into Cancer in the cedurial vadic system depending on what perspective you want to use. So it's a double confluence for this sense of expansion in the housing market. We've already seen uh things like Trump uh trying to get these 50-year mortgages off the ground. We also have seen that he doesn't want to build too many houses because homeowners will lose their wealth. So, I think the housing bubble actually is going to increase and increase and increase in 2026, which is great if you're a homeowner, not so great if you're not a homeowner, but I think this is going to increase and then 2027 presents a high risk period for housing. I think 2027, we could see a housing bubble burst across the Western world, but for 2026, it's just going to continue into an unsustainable bubble. And when the time 2027 comes around, it'll be so unsustainable that that bubble will fall and uh burst. So, if you're a homeowner, um good for 2026. You know, don't sell early 2026. Wait till the effects of late 2026. You might find that your properties are worth even more. You know, even though for those who don't own their homes, it's already kind of insane and crazy. So for if you don't own a home or if you're thinking of maybe putting a deposit down, I'd wait until 2027 2028 because I think there's a real risk of a of a housing crash around there in my very humble opinion. Just uh from what I've researched uh from the financial astrology. Remember guys, I want you to confluence my predictions here and my research with other people, other news that you get other social media people. You need to confluence these research bits uh with your other news sources. uh you know if I'm saying that real estate is going to increase check what the real estate experts are saying does it align uh if I'm saying that there's a tech bubble burst happening in February does it align with what the market is saying you know but it's going to be really fun to see if this plays out over uh 2026 so kind of testing my financial astrology research skills putting myself out there open to these failing but I'm fairly confident that we may see a couple of these play out and I'll be back here in the end of 2026 to review how that goes and then we'll do a yearly predictions for 2027.

  "irh7YJIUfss": "According to Vdic astrology, 2026 is going to be one of the most difficult years of our lives. But most people are going to tell you that this is the year of the bull. And for the first half of the year, they're going to be correct cuz there's going to be booming markets and optimism everywhere. However, in the second half of 2026, everything changes. We're not just talking about a correction. We're talking about a full-on stock market crash, potentially a new virus, riots and wars, and chaos everywhere. And in this video, I will give you guys a monthby month breakdown so that you don't get caught up in this trap. Hey guys, welcome back to Chariot Palistry, where we help you navigate your life by predicting world events, life cycles, and finances. My name is Sulab Jane and in this video we're going to be having a look at the bipolar energy of 2026. I'll give you a monthby-month breakdown of exactly what's going to happen. But first, let me throw up my decade cheat sheet to show you that we've actually been predicting this years ahead. And as you can see on the top half of this screen, I was expecting this period of optimism to go from 2023 into 2026. However, in the second half of this year into the end of 2027, I've labeled this as a complete disaster. By the way, the start of that optimism period was actually the end of co which we ended up predicting. And so when I say that there's a disaster looming, I have a track record of predicting this stuff. What I'd like to do in this video is prepare you guys for this transition from optimism into disaster. So, let's make some predictions on what's going to happen. And my first prediction is that from January through to April, there are going to be multiple new wars in the world. I'm especially looking at the entire month of January and the middle of March through most of April especially. It's being a volatile period. And then despite the fact that there will be new wars in January, I'm expecting a first stock market correction to take place from February through to March. And whilst that first market correction will affect finances, it's also going to be a very difficult time for people at a personal level. Over February and March, just expect that you'll be frayed, tired, and drained, and completely exhausted. It's not a good time, but it's not the period of disaster. It's like the calm before the storm. However, then from April through to June, I think the markets are actually going to rally and there's going to be a lot more money printing taking place. However, then in July, I think there's going to be some kind of second correction that takes place. Now, this isn't going to be the final crash, but it's the second canary in the coal mine we need to pay attention to. And also in this June July period we're expecting a gold correction and also real estate to start booming. In fact from July through to about August September I think the top of the real estate market is going to be formed and then in August and September there's going to be a period of extreme political chaos. I'm actually thinking there's going to be a lot of riots and potentially even terrorist attacks that take place in this time. Now, these are predictions I don't like making and unfortunately we just kind of have a track record of getting most of them correct. We predicted most of the rights in the world over 2025 and this is a key period in 2026 where I think they're going to spike up again. That will lead us into August and September which will be another difficult period for people at a personal level. You know, if you felt exhausted and tired and drained over February and March, it's going to be a repeat of that same energy in the month of August. There's also going to be a third market correction taking place here. This could be the antecedent to the final crash because also from August to October, I'm predicting a new virus to affect the world. I don't know at this stage if it's going to be as devastating as co that's more or less up to the politicians at the time to decide. But I'm also saying that well there's political chaos and riots and then there's a new virus at almost the same time. So I'm not optimistic that our politicians will do the right thing by public health. We'll just have to revisit this in a few months to see how out of control things get. And that leads us into October where I'm expecting a real estate crash. However, it's not all bad because somewhere between October and November, I'm expecting the crypto market to bottom and a new bull market to begin. It is at around about the same time that we're thinking there's major major money printing happening around the world. And by the end of December, there should also be the first variant of the new virus. Now, if you guys want to know my logic in predicting this new virus, click on this video over here and I'll see you there. Thanks a lot, guys.",
  "9o5M5vNP7eQ": "की मैंने गोल्ड एंड सिल्वर के ऊपर प्रेडिक्शन दी थी कि और यह जून 2023 में ही मैंने प्रेडिक्शन दे दी थी। कुछ एक लोग थे जिन्होंने इन्वेस्टमेंट किए, मुनाफा बनाया। पैसा जो फिक्स्ड डिपॉजिट में पड़ा हुआ है, सिल्वर खरीद लेते, गोल्ड खरीद लेते। एंड कैसे आप इन्वेस्टमेंट प्लान करते हैं? अगर मैं 2026 की बात करूं। यह जो मैं प्रेडिक्शन दे रहा हूं आपको 19th मार्च 2026 के बाद वाली है। लेकिन तैयारी आपको पहले ही करनी होगी। [संगीत] 25 में तो बहुत ज्यादा फिल्में प्लॉट हो रही है। हो गया। 25 एंड तक महाराष्ट्र में बॉलीवुड का समय बहुत खराब चलेगा। 2026 में पूरी दुनिया भारत को टूरिज्म की दृष्टि से। [संगीत] [संगीत] दोस्तों वंदे मातरम। एक कहावत है कि आप जिंदगी में कितना भी कुछ कर लीजिए, कितनी भी स्पीड बना लीजिए लेकिन कभी ना कहीं भी कहीं ना कहीं कुछ तो छूट ही जाएगा। ऐसे बहुत सारे लोग हैं आज भी जो मेरे पुराने वीडियोस देखते थे जिन्होंने मेरी प्रेडिक्शनंस देखी थी। जब उन्होंने देखा था कि मैंने गोल्ड एंड सिल्वर के ऊपर प्रेडिक्शन दी थी कि कौन सा वह समय होगा जब गोल्ड की कीमतें आसमान छुएंगी और यह जून 2023 में ही मैंने प्रेडिक्शन दे दी थी और जो भी मैंने बताया था आज ऐसा ही हो रहा है जैसे मैंने बताया था और इन्हीं में से कुछ ऐसे भी लोग थे जो वीडियोस देखते थे कुछ एक लोग थे जिन्होंने इन्वेस्टमेंट किए मुनाफा बनाया कुछ लोग ऐसे भी थे जिन्होंने खुद तो नहीं बनाया लेकिन अपने आसपड़ोस मित्रों रिश्तेदारों को जान पहचान वालों को मेरे वीडियोस भी शेयर किए बताया भी कि फला एस्ट्रोलॉजर यह कह रहा है शायद ऐसा होगा मे बी आप ट्राई कर लीजिए और बाकी लोगों ने प्रॉफिट बनाया लेकिन खुद नहीं बना पाए तो कहीं ना कहीं वो एक रिपेंटेंस पछतावा कि काश हम भी अपना पैसा जो फिक्स्ड डिपॉजिट में पड़ा हुआ है सिल्वर खरीद लेते गोल्ड खरीद लेते तो वहां 7% मिल रहा था। लेकिन यहां पर तो 100% से ऊपर के रिटर्न मिलते हैं। देखिए पछताइए मत। इसलिए मैंने कहा ना कि जिंदगी में कुछ भी कर लीजिए लेकिन कुछ तो छूट ही जाएगा। कितना भी कोशिश कर लीजिए। और एक बात और भी है। अब क्वेश्चन आता है कि जो लोग छूट गए तो क्या अभी भी वह मुनाफा बना सकते हैं? दोस्तों ऐसा नहीं है कि कोई वर्ष निकल गया तो अगला वर्ष कमजोर है या आगे आप पैसा नहीं बना सकते हैं। ऐसा नहीं होता है। मृत्यु लोक है। सत्ताएं बदलती हैं। सिस्टम बदलते हैं। कभी अर्थव्यवस्था किसी देश की ऊपर जाती है। कभी नीचे किसी वर्ष में कुछ सेक्टर्स बहुत ऊपर चले जाते हैं। कुछ नीचे चले जाते हैं। अब बस समझने की देर है कि आप पहले उन चीजों को कैसे भामते हैं एंड कैसे आप इन्वेस्टमेंट प्लान करते हैं। अगर मैं 2026 की बात करूं। यह जो मैं प्रेडिक्शन दे रहा हूं आपको 19th मार्च 2026 के बाद वाली है। लेकिन तैयारी आपको पहले ही करनी होगी। इसका एक आधार भी है। याद कीजिए। आप Google में स्ट्स देख सकते हैं। मैंने जब वीडियो दिया था 2 मार्च 2025 को तब मैंने बताया था कि 29 मार्च 2025 से विक्रमी संवत 2082 शुरू होगा और सूर्य राजा होंगे। सूर्य ही मंत्री होंगे। गोल्ड की कीमतें उसी दिन से आसमान छुएंगी। 1 लाख में जाने के योग बनेंगे। तो 29th मार्च 2025 का ही वह दिन था जिस दिन गोल्ड अराउंड 1 लाख पहुंच गया था इंक्लूडिंग जीएसटी। तो उसी का आधार मानते हुए अगर मैं अगले वर्ष की भी एक प्रेडिक्शन दूं। मंगल सेनापति है, देवुरु बृहस्पति जो कि राजा रहेंगे और यह नहीं कि अगर वह सत्ता संभालेंगे तो उनसे मिलती जुलती चीजें फायदे में रहेंगी। कई बार नुकसान भी दे देती है। जैसे किसी ने क्वेश्चन भी पूछा था हमारे एक वीडियो में कमेंट आया था। किसी व्यक्ति ने पूछा था कि अगर सूर्य राजा और मंत्री था विक्रमी संवत 2082 में तो सूर्य का जो धातु है वह गोल्ड है तो पीएसयू सेक्टर्स क्यों नहीं ऊपर चले गए? आप सोचिए क्या मैंने कभी बताया था कि पीएसयू सेक्टर्स बहुत ऊपर चले जाएंगे? मैंने कभी बताया भी नहीं था। अब यही तो गणना करने का तरीका है कि अगर एक ही कोई प्लनेट उसके उससे अगर संबंध रखते हैं कुछ एक सेक्टर्स तो यह जरूरी नहीं कि सारे के सारे सेक्टर्स ऊपर चले जाएंगे। यही तो दोस्तों मंडेन एस्ट्रोलॉजी में विश्लेषण करने होते हैं कि अगर कोई प्लनेट है कोई राजा या मंत्री बनने वाला है तो उनसे संबंधित वो कौन से सेक्टर्स हैं जो सबसे बड़ा फायदा देंगे। उनमें निवेश करना सबसे बेहतरीन होगा। तो अगर मैं 2026 की बात करूं तो मंगल सेनापति है। देव गुरु बृहस्पति राजा होंगे। तो पहले हम जुपिटर पे आ जाते हैं गुरु से। देखिए गुरु का अधिपत्य है खानेपीने वाले चीजों पे के ऊपर और भी बहुत सारे सेक्टर्स हैं। लॉ फर्म्स एटसेट्रा एजुकेशन सेक्टर बहुत सारी इंडस्ट्रीज। तो कुछ एक इंडस्ट्रीज एजुकेशन इंडस्ट्री से संबंधित जो भी शेयर्स होंगे 26 में मार्च के बाद बंपर उछाल होगा और यह जो प्रेडिकशंस जो मैं दे रहा हूं यह मार्च 2027 तक आप इनको लेकर चलिए इसके साथ-साथ डिवाइन साइंस में अगर कोई अपना आईपीओ ल्च करता है। वैसे तो है नहीं ऐसी कोई चीजें उनमें भी बड़े फायदे मिलेंगे। फूड सेक्टर आई नो आप लोग कहेंगे कि फूड सेक्टर में तो एफएमसीजी में तो ऐसे कोई बड़े उछाल होते नहीं है और सच भी है क्योंकि आपकी अगर मार्केट नीचे क्रैश हो भी जाती है जैसे कोविड टाइम में 40% के आसपास मार्केट नीचे चली गई थी बहुत सारे सेक्टर्स नीचे चले गए थे लेकिन एफएमसीजी फूड सेक्टर एक स्टेबिलिटी में थे क्योंकि दोस्तों लोगों को खाना तो खाना ही है और इन सेक्टर्स में बहुत बड़ा रिटर्न नहीं होता है अराउंड 7 से 10 12% का ही रिटर्न रहता है हर वर्ष। लेकिन यह जो मार्च 2026 से मार्च 2027 की बात करूं तो यह जो फूड सेक्टर्स हैं एफएमसीजी से संबंधित जो इंड जो शेयर्स रहेंगे इनमें नॉट ऑल द शेयर्स कुछ एक शेयर्स वो अभी आपको अपने रिसर्च एनालिस्ट से ही भी विश्लेषण करवाना होगा। यह बात अलग है कि आपकी कुंडली का भी फिफ्थ हाउस बताता है कि फिफ्थ हाउस से संबंधित वो कौन से शेयर्स होंगे जो आपको सूट आएंगे। तो कई बार फाइनेंशियल एस्ट्रोलॉजर एंड कॉर्पोरेट एस्ट्रोलॉजर एंड जो स्टॉक मार्केट एस्ट्रोलॉजर हैं जिनकी रिसर्च रहती है वो लोग भी कई बार गाइड कर देते हैं। तो एफएमसीजी में पैसा लगाना मात्र मान के चलिए कि पहले की बजाय अच्छे रिटर्न्स मिलेंगे इस ड्यूरेशन में। अब बात आती है कि मंगल क्या करेंगे? सेनापति हैं। मंगल से अभिप्राय यहां पर डिफेंस सेक्टर से है। पहले भी मैंने डिफेंस के बारे में प्रेडिक्शन दी हैं। ड्यूरेशंस दी थी कि इन ड्यूरेशन में जब हमने पाकिस्तान के ऊपर एयर स्ट्राइक की थी चार दिन लगातार और यह प्रेडिक्शन मैंने उससे अराउंड 50 दिन पहले ही कर दी थी कि उस पर्टिकुलर समय सीमा में डिफेंस ऑलमोस्ट डबल हो जाएगा। हो भी गया था। अब करेक्शन थोड़े बहुत तो करेक्शन दोस्तों होंगे क्योंकि जो बड़े प्लेयर्स ऊपर बैठे हुए हैं उन्हें अपना मुनाफा भी तो बनाना है और देखिए अक्सर शेयर मार्केट में वही लोग पैसा बनाते हैं जो बड़े प्लेयर्स हैं। उन्हें ही पता होता है कि मार्केट को कहां हिलाना है, कैसे झंझोलना है। एंड कई बार जो छोटा इन्वेस्टर होता है, वह मार्केट से एग्जिट करके निकल भी जाता है। डर में चला जाता है कि भाई, यह तो हमारे लिए है ही नहीं। तो डिफेंस अगले वर्ष एक बड़ी बड़ा इन्वेस्टमेंट होगा। मतलब बड़े प्रॉफिट देखने को मिलेंगे। दो से तीन गुना के भी रिटर्न के चांसेस होंगे। एंड मंगल की भी बात करें देश की मंगल की महादशा तो आप यह भी मान के चलिए कि मंगल की महादशा चलेगी देश की कुंडली में सितंबर 2032 तक। तो भारत डिफेंस में बहुत बड़ा व्यापार करने वाला है आने वाले समय में और बहुत सारी कंट्रीज को हम लोग बड़े पैमाने पर सप्लाई भी देने वाले हैं हर तरह के वेपन्स की और वेपन्स में आप सोचिए क्या-क्या लगता है। मेटल्स, आपका कॉपर, आयरन, स्टील हर तरह की धातुएं। तो आप अभी खुद लिस्ट आउट कीजिए कि वह कौन-कौन से मेटल्स हैं और या कौन-कौन से ऐसे मटेरियल्स हैं जो वेपन्स बनाने के काम आते हैं और वो जो मटेरियल्स हैं कौन-कौन सी कंपनीज़ हैं जो उन मटेरियल्स को बनाती हैं उस पर काम करती हैं। एंड उससे रिलेटेड छोटे-छोटे पार्ट्स कौन सी कंपनियां बनाती हैं? कौन से कोई ऐसे चिप्स बनते हैं? कॉपर का भरपूर प्रयोग देखा जाएगा अगले वर्ष में। कॉपर कई सारी चीजों पर में प्रयोग में देखा जाएगा। आयरन स्टील की कीमतें बहुत ज्यादा बढ़ने के लिए तैयार होंगी। आज भी पिछले ऑलमोस्ट चारप वर्षों से कुछ ऐसी स्टील कंपनीज़ के शेयर्स हैं जो बढ़ते हैं। डबल के आसपास होते हैं। फिर करेक्ट हो के वहीं चले जाते हैं। अगले वर्ष देखिएगा इन शेयर्स का क्या होगा। अगेन शेयर्स जब भी आप लें प्रॉपर चार्ट एनालिसिस कंपनीज़ का करें। छोटी कंपनीज़ में ऐसी कंपनीज़ में पैसा ना लगा दें। जिन जिन कंपनीज के अस्तित्व का आपको खुद डर हो कि कहीं यह कंपनीज़ डूब तो नहीं जाएंगी। आप सोचिए किंग फिशर जैसी कंपनी विजय मालिया की ₹100 का स्टॉक था कभी। आप सोचिए जिन्होंने लिए होंगे लाखों स्टॉक्स होंगे इन जिन लोगों के पास। आप सोचिए वो लोग तो अरबपति बन चुके होंगे उन दिनों में। क्या हुआ था ऐसे स्टॉक्स का? धड़ाम से नीचे गिरे थे। डी लिस्ट तक हो गए थे। तो एक तो यह हुआ इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स सेक्टर अगले वर्ष में इलेक्ट्रॉनिक में सब कुछ आ जाता है आपका एवरीथिंग गैजेट्स हर तरह के तो यह कंपनियां बहुत ज्यादा राइज करेंगी 2026 में। इसके साथ-साथ फर्टिलाइजर्स एंड केमिकल सेक्टर्स यह भी बड़ा उछाल देने वाले हैं। अब यह जो केमिकल एंड फ़र्टिलाइज़र्स हैं, इसमें कुछ मैं एक डेट्स भी कैलकुलेट किए हैं मैंने 2026 में एक समय सीमा कि वह कौन से नक्षत्राज हैं जो वेद करने वाले हैं वाटरी प्लनेट्स के साथ, वाटरी नक्षत्रास के साथ और चंद्रमा कब सक्रिय होगा और ऐसी जो डेट्स बनाई जाती हैं कमोडिटीज में जिसे खुदरा मार्केट कहा जाता है। तो अभी तक के जो विश्लेषण रहे हैं एक्यूरेसी उसमें ऑलमोस्ट रही है ऑलवेज। अब ऐसे में आप लोगों को कुछ शॉट्स आप लोगों को मिल जाएंगे। आप उन शॉट्स को देख लीजिएगा। कुछ वीडियोस भी दिए होंगे। तो उनमें लेकिन आप अपना विवेक का भी प्रयोग जरूर करें कि इन सेक्टर्स में रिटर्न कब एग्जिट करना है, कब निकलना है। देखिए वह तो आपको अपना विवेक का प्रयोग करना है। बाकी दोस्तों कुछ ऐसे भी और सेक्टर्स हैं जिनके ऊपर अभी मेरे विश्लेषण चल रहे हैं और मैं आपको उन सेक्टर्स के बारे में भी फिर से एक वीडियो देने वाला हूं। तब तक के लिए थोड़ा सा आपको इंतजार भी करना होगा और जाते-जाते मैं एक बात आप लोगों को कहना चाहूंगा। ऐसे बहुत सारे लोग हैं जो आज भी कहते हैं कि उनके आसपोस में किसी व्यक्ति ने शेयर्स मार्केट में पैसा लगाया। बहुत पैसा बना लिया। लेकिन जब उन लोगों ने पैसा लगाया तो पैसा बनने की बजाय पैसा डूब गया। मैंने पहले भी मेरे कई वीडियोस में बताया है कि मत कीजिए। अगर आपको यह मार्केट सूट नहीं करती है। बिल्कुल भी इस मार्केट में मत एंटर कीजिए। पहले तो आप अपनी कुंडली का फिफ्थ हाउस चेक करवाइए। नवमाश में भी चेक करवाइए कि आपके फिफ्थ हाउस में कितना बलाबल है। क्या सर्वाष्टक में फिफ्थ हाउस में स्कोर अराउंड 30 से ऊपर है। क्या जो दशाएं महादशाएं अंतरर्दशाएं चल रही हैं तो जो भिनाष्टक में जो बिंदु मिलते हैं जिन्हें पॉइंट्स कहा जाता है। क्या फोर पॉइंट से ऊपर हैं या नहीं है? नहीं है। मत उस समय में आप मार्केट में रहिए। फॉर द टाइम बीइंग एग्जिट कर जाइए। क्योंकि उस समय आपके लिए हुए निर्णय हमेशा ही गलत साबित होंगे। मार्केट कहीं और जा रही होगी और आप कहीं और निकल रहे होंगे। जब लोग खरीद रहे होंगे आप बेच रहे होंगे। जब लोग बेच रहे होंगे आप उन्हीं शेयर्स को खरीद रहे होंगे। यही तो होता है कुंडली का खेल। जब आपके भाग्य में है ही नहीं। जब आपकी कुंडली में फिफ्थ हाउस का कनेक्शन नाइंथ 11th सेकंड के साथ मिनिमम एंड जुपिटर के साथ अगर संबंध नहीं बनता है या जुपिटर के नक्षत्रों के साथ कहीं पे भी कनेक्टिविटी नहीं बैठ रही है लग्न में भी या नवमाश में भी तो आपको स्टॉक मार्केट फलेगी नहीं। चाहे वो फ्यूचर एंड ऑप्शंस हो उसमें तो वैसे भी बहुत कम लोगों का लक होता है। इनफैक्ट स्विंग ट्रेडिंग में भी लोग लॉस खा जाते हैं। और जब मैंने देखा है कि जब लक अच्छा ना हो तो लोग लॉन्ग टर्म इन्वेस्टमेंट में भी मार खा जाते हैं। जैसे कि मैंने किंग फिशर का आपको एक एग्जांपल दिया और भी कुछ कंपनियां जो एक ब्लू स्मार्ट कंपनी थी जो कैब्स का पीछे व्यवसाय करती थी। शेयर का नाम भूल गया। मेरी रिक्वेस्ट है आप लोग एक कमेंट कर दीजिएगा क्योंकि अभी मैं अगर Google आउट करने जाऊंगा तो समय लगेगा। तो यह शेयर का नाम मैंने लिया था पहले भी जो 2400 2500 से अभी 202 आ चुका है। तो सोचिए कि अगर आपने बनाया भी था तो समय पे आपने एग्जिट नहीं किया था और लोअर पर लोअर सर्किट लगते वह शेयर्स खत्म हो चुके हैं। और कई लोग तो क्या गलती करते हैं? सारा पैसा किसी एक ही शेयर्स में लगा देते हैं। मत कीजिए यह काम। कम से कम 100 से 150 शेयर्स के के बीच में अपना पैसा लगाइए। एक रेश्यो बनाइए। एक सिस्टम बनाइए कि इन सेक्टर्स को पकड़ना है। एक सब में एक पोर्शन में पैसा लगाना है। क्योंकि जब कोई सेक्टर गिरता है और दूसरा उस समय उठ भी रहा होता है तो आपका पोर्टफोलियो बैलेंस रहता है। डरते नहीं हो आप। नींद आती है आपको। अगर एक ही सेक्टर में पैसा लगाओगे नींदें उड़ जाती हैं। और मैं फिर कहूंगा कि आप लोगों के लिए अगर आपको कोई डाउट है अपनी कुंडली को लेकर अगर आप मार्केट के सताए हुए हैं, पैसा डूबा ही है तो किसी फाइनेंशियल कॉर्पोरेट या किसी स्टॉक मार्केट एस्ट्रोलॉजर से अपनी कुंडली का विश्लेषण जरूर करवाइए। पूछिए कि क्या सूट करता है आपको? अगर स्टॉक मार्केट भी सूट नहीं करती है तो और बेहतरीन आप क्या कर सकते हैं भविष्य में? ऐसे बहुत सारे लोगों को मैं जानता हूं जो स्टॉक मार्केट में बिल्कुल भी कनेक्टेड नहीं है। बट दे आर इन्वेस्टर्स एंड वो कई बार एक दिन में भी अपना पैसा डबल कर लेते हैं। दोस्तों ऐसे भी बहुत सारे बिजनेसेस हैं। तो कुंडलियों का विश्लेषण करवाइए प्रॉपर। फिर आगे बढ़िए। नुकसान मत करवाइए आप अपना। और कई लोगों का आग्रह भी होता है कि मुझसे कुंडली दिखाना चाहते हैं। दोस्तों स्क्रीन पर नंबर दिया हुआ है। डिस्क्रिप्शन बॉक्स में इसी वीडियो के कंसीडेशन के लिंक दिए हुए हैं। आप उन पर क्लिक कर सकते हैं एंड वो लिंक आपको हमारी वेबसाइट पर ले जाएगा। वहां पर आप अपनी चॉइस तय कर सकते हैं कि आपको मुझसे कंसल्टेशन चाहिए या मेरी जो बनाई हुई टीम है रिसर्चर्स की एस्ट्रोलॉजर्स की उनसे चाहिए या रिपोर्टिंग सिस्टम भी है या मुझसे मिलना भी चाहते हैं इट्स टोटली अप टू यू। तो आज के लिए मुझे इजाजत दीजिए। धन्यवाद। जय हिंद। भारत माता की जय।",
  "HF2c2ogOSzI": "चिराग सर ये प्रॉब्लम हो गई है भारतीय बाजारों में वो क्या है पिछले अब क्या 15 16 महीने हो गए हैं जहां से शुरू कर रहा था 16 महीने बाद वहीं आके खड़े हुए हैं वहीं आके अटक रहे हैं मतलब 16 महीने में लिटरली कुछ कमा के दिया नहीं है इस बाजार ने हमको ये नया साल साल 2026 सर कैसा रहेगा सितारे कहते क्या है कमाई होगी हम रिटेल की या नहीं होने वाली है ऐसे ही निकलने वाला है समय श्री गणेशाय नमः देखिए 25 का जो साल है वो है मंगल का साल। मंगल यानी एग्रेसिव प्लनेट है। आपके जीवन में आपके पोर्टफोलियो में अगर एग्रेसिवली या तुरंत आपने कुछ डिसीजन ले लिया तो शायद आपको उसका अच्छा मोनेरी बेनिफिट मिल सकता है। पर अगर हम बात करें 2026 की क्योंकि 2025 में तो शायद इन्वेस्टर्स कुछ लोगों ने अच्छा कमाया भी कुछ लोगों ने नहीं भी कमाया और अगर आप देखें कि ग्लोबल मार्केट्स भी काफी अप्स डाउन अप डाउन जो चल रहा था बट 202620% भारत अपना डंका बजाएगा। भारत अपना डंका बजाएगा तो क्या होगा? तो फॉरर्चूनेटली आप यह कह सकते हैं 26 में भारत का जो शेयर बाजार है, ससेक्स है, निफ्टी है उसमें जरूर से आपको पॉजिटिविटी देखने को मिलेगी। ग्लोबल बाजार भले कितना भी ऊपर नीचे जाए बट 2026 का जो साल है वो साल है सूर्य का साल। तो अगर सूर्य आपकी कुंडली में मजबूत है तो 1120% आपने कहीं पे भी निवेश किया है उसका आपको रिटर्न मिलेगा। बट अगर हम बात करते हैं ओवरऑल मार्केट की तो 26 में हमें काफी अच्छा रिटर्न्स देखने को मिलेगा और जो ग्रहों का गोचर है गुरु का जो गोचर है जो जून में आने वाला है उससे भी काफी अच्छा बेनिफिट हमें देखने को मिल सकता है। साथ साथ में सबसे बड़ी हमारी जो अर्थव्यवस्था है उसका हमारा जो जीडीपी है उसमें भी अच्छा ग्रोथ देखने को मिलेगा। यानी भारतीय शेयर बाजार 2026 में हमें अच्छा रिटर्न देगा। आपको थोड़ा सा भी स्ट्रेस लेने की जरूरत नहीं है। थोड़ा सा भी डिप्रेशन में जाने की जरूरत नहीं है। अगर आपके कोई भी शेयर्स आपके पोर्टफोलियो में शायद 10% 20% 25% डाउन भी चल रहा है तो आपको एकदम हाइपर नहीं हो जाना है। थोड़ा सा मन को शांत रखना है। और मैं सभी निवेशकों को जो भी इन्वेस्टर्स है उनको एक ही सलाह देता हूं कि आप रोजाना 15 से 20 मिनट मेडिटेशन करिए। मेडिटेशन करेंगे तो आपका मन शांत रहेगा। मन शांत रहेगा तो आप बहुत सारे डिसीजंस ले पाएंगे और 2026 में जो भी आपके पोर्टफोलियो में नेगेटिविटी है यानी जो माइनस में है जो शेयर्स उसका आपको अच्छा रिटर्न मिलेगा। अच्छा हम अगर बात करें के कौन से सेक्टर्स हमारे लिए बेहतर रहेंगे तो सबसे पहले तो हम आएंगे एनर्जी सेक्टर। दूसरा है एआई सेक्टर। तीसरा है इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर सेक्टर और चौथा है रिन्यूएबल एनर्जी। और पांचवे की अगर बात करें तो आप यह कह सकते हैं कि ये सभी सेक्टर्स हमें अच्छा रिटर्न्स देंगे। पर थोड़ा सा आपको धैर्य रखने की जरूरत है। हेल्थ केयर इंडस्ट्री मतलब एक इन्वेस्टेड रहा हूं। 2026 साल ले दे के पॉजिटिव रिटर्न्स वाला साल होगा। हम रिटेल की कमाई होगी। हां उठापटक होगी। उसके लिए हम मेडिटेट करें। थोड़ा सा कामनेस लेकर आए अपने अंदर। ऐसा करो। मतलब सब 2026 हम सबके लिए अच्छा रहने वाला है। सर ये चिराग सर है ना? जबरदस्त। अच्छा एक फिर एक बात बताओ आपने दुनिया की बात करी। ये 2025 ना मामला जिओपॉलिटिकली बड़ा गड़बड़ रहा। जो जो हमारे लिए भी सर दर्द रहा हमारे नेबर्स के साथ और आज भी हमारे नेबर्स हमारे लिए सर दर्द बने हुए हैं। जिस तरह से अनरेस्ट चल ही रहा है हर तरफ ग्लोबली सर दर्द बने हुए हैं। ये 2026 ईयर ऑफ पीस रहेगा या ऐसे ही मामला दुनिया वाले बढ़ेगा। 2026 भी आप यह कह सकते हैं कि जब ये उतरता है मंगल अभी फिनिश हुआ समझो। पर फिनिश होते होते भी आप ऐसा कह सकते हैं भले सूर्य शुरू हो गया पर तीन चार महीने तक थोड़ा उतारचढ़ाव जैसा रह सकता है। मिक्स मैच रिजल्ट्स मिल सकते हैं। पर अगर आप ओवरऑल देखने जाए तो हमारा जो शेयर बाजार है, हमारा जो मार्केट है या भारत की अर्थव्यवस्था की बात करते हैं तो 26 में भारत का डंका बजेगा। इन्वेस्टर्स को थोड़ा सा भी चिंता करने की जरूरत नहीं है। गदगद कर दिया चिराग जी आपने। चिराग जी गुड आफ्टरनून श्रेया बात कर रही हूं और दिल गदगद कर दिया आप से बातचीत करके। इतना अच्छा लग रहा है। पॉजिटिविटी आ गई है और एक उम्मीद की किरण जागी है सभी इन्वेस्टर्स में और सेक्टर्स भी इनफैक्ट आपने बताए कहां-कहां पर दांव लगना चाहिए। लेकिन मेरा सवाल उन इन्वेस्टर्स की तरफ से है जो 2026 में पहली बार निवेश करना चाह रहे हैं। आपने कहा 2026 सूर्य का साल हो सकता है। तो ऐसा कौन सा महीना ले पकड़े जब एक इन्वेस्टर नया इन्वेस्टर बाजार में एंट्री करें। कोई भी देखिए जो फर्स्ट टाइम निवेश कर रहे हैं राइट तो उनके लिए सबसे पहली सलाह यह है कि अगर फॉर एग्जांपल आप ₹100 इन्वेस्ट करने का विचार कर रहे हैं या आपका बजट है कि मुझे ₹100 निवेश करने है राइट तो इनिशियल लेवल पे जनवरी में फरवरी में आप ₹30 ही इन्वेस्ट करिए और तब तक आप देखिए कि आपको कितना रिटर्न मिल रहा है क्या अप्स एंड डाउन्स हो रहे हैं और साथ-साथ में क्या होता है कि अगर आपने ₹ भी निवेश किए और शायद वो माइनस में जा रहा होगा तो कुछ इन्वेस्टर्स एकदम हाइपर हो जाते हैं। तो ऐसे इन्वेस्टर्स के लिए यह सलाह देंगे कि आप जो भी निवेश करना चाहते हैं तो स्टार्टिंग के तीन चार महीने में आप उसका 30 40% ही निवेश करें और चार पांच राशियों की हम बात करेंगे जिनका ये साल है जिनको शेयर बाजार में से यानी जो नए इन्वेस्टर्स भी है उन लोगों की अगर ये राशियों में से राशियां है तो आप यह समझ लीजिए कि 100 कर रहे हैं तो 200% भी अगर वो निवेश करना चाहते हैं तो भी उनको अच्छा रिटर्न मिलेगा वो राशियां है पहली राशि सिंह राशि दूसरी राशि कन्या राशि तीसरी राशि मकर राशि चौथी राशि कुंभ राशि और पांचवी राशि मीन राशि ये पांच राशियों का यह साल है। शेयर बाजार में जो ऑलरेडी निवेशक है जो ऑलरेडी इन्वेस्टर्स है या जो नए इन्वेस्टर्स आना चाहते हैं मार्केट चिराग सर आपने मिथुन की तो बात ही नहीं करी। अच्छा मेरे सहयोगी हरमास पूछ रहे थे हम लोग कि सैलरी इंक्रीमेंट से बैठ गया। इस बार कुछ मामला सुधरेगा क्या? सैलरी इंक्रीमेंट के लिए मार्च से लेके अगस्त का जो समय है वो बहुत बेहतरीन समय है और खास करके मिथुन राशि वालों के लिए। वाह क्या बोला आपने? मार्च से लेकर हम ये लाइव बोल रहे हैं टीवी पे। आपको इतना अशोरेंस देते हैं कि अगर आपका इंक्रीमेंट होता है तो लाइव टीवी पे ही आप हमें जवाब भी दीजिएगा कि इंक्रीमेंट अगर इंक्रीमेंट होता है उसमें भी डाउट है क्या? अरे ऐसे मत बोलो यार नहीं हम ऐसा बता रहे हैं कि आपका इंक्रीमेंट हो जाता है तो यही लाइव टीवी पे भी आप बोलिएगा कि मैं पक्का बोलूंगा अच्छा आपने कहा मार्च से लेकर अगस्त के बीच में है ना 1120% अपना इंक्रीमेंट कब आएगा अगस्त बस अगस्त में चिराग सर इस बढ़िया से पॉजिटिव नोट पर थैंक यू सो मच 2026 सितारों के लिहाज से तारों के लिहाज से बढ़िया साल रहेगा थोड़ा थोड़ा पेशेंस रखें। बढ़िया पॉजिटिव रिटर्न्स मिलेंगे और खास तौर पर पांच सन साइन उनके लिए तो खैर अच्छा समय है। हां। एक एक अंतिम चीज गणेश जी के आशीर्वाद से और हमारे बापू जी श्री बेजान दारू वाला जी के आशीर्वाद से सभी निवेशकों को अच्छा रिटर्न मिले। यही प्रभु से प्रार्थना है कि नया साल सबके लिए बहुत बेहतरीन जाए। श्री गणेशाय नमः। श्री गणेशा। थैंक यू सर। थैंक यू जुड़ने के लिए।",
  "zLC-3F8JwrM": "मेरे YouTube पेज एस्ट्रोज पर आपका स्वागत है। नमस्कार, मैं हूं नरेश कुमार। सबसे पहले उन दर्शकों का धन्यवाद जिन्होंने पेज को सब्सक्राइब किया है। पेज के वीडियोस को शेयर कर रहे हैं, लाइक कर रहे हैं और कमेंट बॉक्स में हमें अपनी राय भी लगातार भेज रहे हैं। दोस्तों, पिछला हफ्ता बड़ा इंटरेस्टिंग रहा है गोल्ड और सिल्वर के लिए। सिल्वर ने ड्रामेटिकली तरीके से लगभग 12% की तेजी दिखाई। गोल्ड 2% तेज रहा। यदि हम इसको पूरे इसको एनालिसिस करते हैं तो जो सिल्वर डिलीवरी है कॉमक्स की वो उसमें $9 लगभग $5 का उछाल आया और यह $1.60 की तेजी के साथ बंद हुआ। यह $88 के आसपास जो है वह कारोबार इस समय कर रहा है। यदि हम इसको वीकली गेन के हिसाब से देखेंगे तो यह लार्जेस्ट वीकली गेन है दिसंबर 2026 के बाद जो हफ्ता खत्म हुआ उसके बाद और यह लगातार दो वीक से अप चल रहा है। इससे पहले वो थोड़ा सा नीचे था। इससे पहला और उससे पहला जो वीक था उसमें थोड़ा सा नीचे था। यह पिछले दो वीक में $.53 की तेजी दिखा चुका है और इसमें टोटल तेजी आई है लगभग 25% की। यानी कि जो इस समय रेट है उसमें 24.85% लगभग 25 85% का 25% की तेजी जो है पिछले दो वीक में आई है। पिछले 11 वीक में से यह 9 वीक लगातार तेजी से काम कर रहा है। यदि हम शुक्रवार की बात करते हैं तो इसमें 4.12% की गिरावट है। यह लगभग $3.78 गिरकर बंद हुआ है पिछले हफ्ते में और पिछले फ्राइडे में और इसने जो लास्ट वीक का जो विनिंग स्टक था उसको थोड़ा सा डाउन कर दिया और जो डिक्लाइन हुआ है यह लार्जेस्ट डिक्लाइन है 7 जनवरी के बाद का और यह जो क्लोज है थर्ड हाईएस्ट क्लोज है हिस्ट्री का और अपने 52 वीक हाई से यह 4.12% नीचे बंद हुआ है। इसका 5 वीक हाई जो था 52 वीक हाई जो था वह 91.87 था। यह कॉमिक्स की डिलीवरी का डाटा है जो मैं आपको बता रहा हूं और यह इसने हाई जो टच किया था वो 15 जनवरी को टच किया था। और यदि मैं इसको 52 वीक हाई से कंपेयर करूं जो 29.11 था उससे यह 202 202% जो है वह तेज है। यह हाई जो लो इसने बनाया था वो 4 अप्रैल 2025 को बनाया था 29.11 का वहां से यह 202% तेज है। और यह 52 वीक हाई की यदि हम बात करते हैं तो 52 अपने 52 वीक हाई में 185% के आसपास की तेजी दिखा चुका है। तो ये कहानी है सिल्वर की। अब आते हैं गोल्ड के ऊपर। गोल्ड जो है जनवरी डिलीवरी यदि हम इसको देखते हैं तो इसमें पिछले हफ्ते $8 की तेजी आई है और इसमें करीब 2.18% का गेन हुआ है पिछले एक हफ्ते में। यह 4588 के आसपास रहा है। इसका जो लास्ट भाव है और यह पिछले लगातार दो हफ्ते से तेजी जो है वह दिखा रहा है और इसने दो हफ्ते में $274 की तेजी दिखाई है। यानी कि लगभग $6.35% ऊपर बंद हुआ है। पिछले दो हफ्ते की यदि हम कंपैरिजन करते हैं तो पांच हफ्ते लगातार जो है वो अह जो है वो तेज तेज रहा है। छह हफ्ते के यदि हम एनालिसिस करते हैं तो छह में से पांच हफ्ते लगातार तेज रहा है। शुक्रवार को यह बंद हुआ लगभग $28 नीचे। इसको परसेंटेज में गिनेंगे तो 0.6 परसेंटेज बनता है। लगभग आधा% जो है वह तेजी के साथ मंदी के साथ बंद हुआ है। और यह वेडनेसडे के बाद के बाद जो है वो डॉलर टर्म में बड़ा डिक्लाइन है 7 जनवरी के बाद बाद का और फिफ्थ हाईएस्ट क्रॉस है यह हिस्ट्री में। यदि हम इसको देखते हैं तो यह लगभग 37.90 नीचे बंद हुआ है। और लास्ट टू सेशन की यदि हम बात करते हैं तो लास्ट टू सेशन में इसने $37.90 जो है वो गिराए हैं। और थ्री ऑफ़ द पास्ट फोर सेशन में से यह जो है वो यदि चार सेशन को हम कंपैरिजन करेंगे तो यह अह तीन सेशन लगातार जो है वो डाउन रहा है। अह चार सेशन में दो सेशन लगातार उससे पहले पॉजिटिव था। फिर उससे पहले नेगेटिव। तो चार में से तीन सेशन ये डाउन रहा है। और यदि हम 52 वीक हाई की बात करते हैं तो इसने 4626 का हाई मारा था। वहां से लगभग 82.82% यानी कि लगभग 1% के आसपास नीचे है। और यह इसने जो हाई मारा था वो 14 जनवरी को मारा था। और यदि हम इसको कंपैरिजन करते हैं 52 वीक हाई से जो इसने 27 जनवरी 2025 को टच किया था। वहां से लगभग यह 68% तेजी के साथ जो है वो ते कारोबार कर रहा है। यह 37 2737 का हाई था इसका। वहां से 67% तेज है और 52 वीक हाई से भी ये 67% के आसपास तेज है। तो अभी हम फंडामेंटल्स की बात करेंगे तो फंडामेंटल में जिओपॉलिटिकल सिनेरियो सबसे पहले देखेंगे कि जिओपॉलिटिकल सिनेरियो जो है वो ईज़ हो गया है। थोड़ा सा इसमें जो है वो राहत मिल गई है क्योंकि पहले बात की जा रही थी कि ट्रंप किसी भी समय में ईरान के ऊपर हमला कर सकता है कर सकते हैं। और अमेरिका जो है वो सैन्य कारवाई के लिए तैयार था। बहुत सारी खबरें आ रही थी। इवन ट्रंप ने थ्रेट भी कर दिया था कि बहुत सारे कॉन्सिक्वेंसेस हो सकते हैं। इसके सीरियस यदि वहां पर प्रोटेस्टर्स के खिलाफ कारवाई होती है। लेकिन बाद में उनका यह बयान आया कि हम फिलहाल यहां पर अटैक नहीं कर रहे और ईरान के साथ हमारी जो है वो बातचीत चल रही है और ईरान मान गया है कि वो कारवाई नहीं करेगा। तो उसके कारण हमने देखा कि शुक्रवार को वीक था बाजार। वैसे भी जो हमारी पिछले वीक की एस्ट्रोलॉजिकल कैलकुलेशन थी उसमें बताया गया था कि 15 को वीक रह सकता है बाजार। 15 और 16 को हमने वीकनेस की बात की थी और 15 को भी वीक रहा और 16 को भी वीक रहा। यह दो दिन आपके अह अच्छे नहीं रहे गोल्ड सिल्वर के निवेशकों के लिए। इसीलिए थोड़ा सा हमें डाउन साइड देखने को मिला। यह हो गई जियोपॉलिटिकल सिनेरियो ईज़ होने की बात। दूसरा फैक्टर आता है फेड रिजर्व। फेड रिजर्व जो है उसकी मीटिंग है 27 और 28 जनवरी को। 27, 28 जनवरी की मीटिंग में फेड जो है वह ब्याज दरों में कटौती का फैसला ले सकता है। यदि ब्याज दरों में कटौती होती है तो अल्टीमेटली यहां पर एक गोल्ड सिल्वर को एक बार फिर पुश मिलेगा। क्योंकि बहुत सारे फेड के जो मेंबर हैं एफओएमसी जो जो उनकी मॉनिटरी कमेटी की कमेटी है फेड की जो इंटरेस्ट रेट के ऊपर डिसीजन लेती है उनके मेंबर्स की स्पीच में हमें ये सिग्नल मिल रहा है कि एक रेट कट आ सकता है और इसके अलावा रूपी डॉलर इंपैक्ट जो है वो हमें देखने को मिलेगा अगले हफ्ते में हमने देखा कि शुक्रवार को रूपी ने वर्स्ट वन डे फॉल दिखाया पिछले दो महीनों में। तो जो है वो थोड़ा सा यह जरूर ध्यान में रखेंगे। फिजिकल मार्केट जो है वो उसकी जो टाइटनेस है वो थोड़ी सी ई ई आउट होनी शुरू हो गई है। यदि हम इसको फिजिकल को देखते हैं सिल्वर को खासतौर पर क्योंकि कॉमक्स के वेयर हाउसेस जो है वो दोबारा यूरोप में आने शुरू हो गए हैं। इसके कारण थोड़ा सा फिजिकल टाइटनेस जो थी वो ई आउट हुई है सिल्वर में। इसके कारण भी हमें मंदी देखने को मिल रही है थोड़ी सी। और इसके अलावा चाइना को यदि हम देखते हैं तो वहां पर स्पेकुलेटिव डिमांड जो है वो बहुत हाई है। अभी भी यदि हम कंपेयर करते हैं तो शघाई का जो प्राइस है वो $10 हाई चल रहा है कॉमक्स के मुकाबले में। इसका मतलब यह है कि फंडामेंटली चाइना एक बड़ा फैक्टर रहेगा। अगले हफ्ते भी रहेगा। लंदन के मुकाबले वहां पर अभी भी $10 यानी कि 10% के आसपास का रेट ज्यादा है। तो अगले हफ्ते यदि कारोबारी दिनों की बात करेंगे तो मार्टिन लूथर किंग्स डे जूनियर्स के जो डे है उसके कारण 20 को कॉमिक्स बंद है। यानी कि 20 को सिर्फ हमारे बाजारों में काम होगा। चाइना में काम होगा और 20 को कॉमिक्स के ऊपर काम नहीं होगा। तो कॉमिक्स से हमें दिशा मिलती है। इसलिए हमें ये जानकारी होना जरूरी है कि 20 को कॉमक्स बंद रहेगा। तो ये तो हो गई बात गोल्ड और सिल्वर के फंडामेंटल की अगले हफ्ते में। अब देखते हैं कि एस्ट्रोलॉजी क्या कहती है। एस्ट्रोलॉजी को यदि हम देखते हैं तो 17 जनवरी को सुबह यानी कि सैटरडे जिस दिन हम ये वीडियो शूट कर रहे हैं 10:27 पर बुध भी मकर राशि में आ गए हैं। यहां पर पहले से शुक्र है, पहले से सूर्य हैं, पहले से मंगल है। तो यह चार ग्रही योग बन गया है। चंद्रमा भी यहीं पर रहेंगे। 19 को सुबह 9:37 पे बुध और शनि 60° एक्सिस पे आ जाएंगे। यह एक्सिस अच्छा नहीं है। यानी कि 19 का दिन भी अच्छा नहीं है। यह वोलेटिलिटी काफी रहेगी। 20 जनवरी को सुबह 1:09 पर मींस मध्य रात्रि 19 और 20 की मध्य रात्रि ट्यूसडे के दिन ये जो यूरेनस है वो अपना नक्षत्र पद बदलेंगे। कृतिका नक्षत्र में इस समय गोचर कर रहे हैं। यह बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट इवेंट है खासतौर पर सिल्वर के लिए। 20 जनवरी को सुबह 11:28 पर मंगल और शनि 60° एक्सिस पे आ जाएंगे। यह एक्सिस भी बाजार में जो है वो भूचाल लाने का काम कर सकता है। हालांकि 20 को कॉमिक्स बंद है। 20 ट्यूसडे को ही 20 जनवरी ट्यूसडे को ही 12:13 पर शनि जो है वो अपने उत्तर भाद्रपद नक्षत्र में प्रवेश करेंगे। राहु ऑलरेडी अपने नक्षत्र में है। बुध अपने जो शनि है वो अपने नक्षत्र में आ जाएंगे। जियोपॉलिटिकल सिनेरियो यहां से डिस्टर्ब होगा। इसके बाद बाजार घूम जाएगा। इसके बाद बाजार में तेजी आनी चाहिए। 21 जनवरी को बुधवार को शुक्र जो है वह श्रवणा नक्षत्र में आ जाएंगे। 2:54 यानी कि मंगल और बुध की रात्रि को शुक्र अपने शुक्र का चंद्रमा के नक्षत्र में आना चांदी के लिए अच्छा है क्योंकि शुक्र और चंद्रमा दोनों ही चांदी के कारक हैं। तो यह यहां पर कंफर्टेबल हो जाएगा। थर्सडे जो है वह थोड़ा सा बेटर दिन लगता है। 2:20 के बाद चंद्रमा भी गुरु के नक्षत्र में आएंगे। यह आपके लिए थोड़ा सा बेटर रहेगा। 21 जनवरी को वेडनेसडे के दिन 9:15 पर रात्रि को सूर्य और बुध 0° कंजक्शन पे आएंगे। बुध और सूर्य का 0° कंजक्शन में आना भी बाजार के लिए थोड़ा सा वोलेटिलिटी लाने का काम कर सकता है। 23 जनवरी फ्राइडे को सुबह 10:27 पे बुध करेंगे एंटर श्रवणा में। यहां पर आपको हो सकता है कि बाजार में थोड़ी सी गिरावट देखने को मिले। इस समय यहां पर सावधान रहेंगे। 24 जनवरी को सैटरडे है और सैटरडे को जो है वह सुबह 10:56 अह 56 पर सूर्य श्रवणा में एंटर करेंगे। लेकिन इस समय बाजार नहीं चल रहा होगा। तो इसका असर हमें अगले हफ्ते में नजर आएगा। तो कुल मिलाकर 19-20 का दिन जो है वो थोड़ा सा डसी लगता है। 19 को हो सकता है दबाव देखने को मिले। 20 के बाद बाजार सुधरना चाहिए। 20 शाम के बाद लगता है कि बाजार सुधरना चाहिए और गुरुवार का दिन दोपहर के समय दोपहर के बाद बाजार में अच्छे जो है वो हमें मूव देखने को मिल सकते हैं। बाकी चंद्रमा की क्या पोजीशन रहेगी? यह मैं अपने डिटेल जो है वह जो हमारा ग्रुप होता है उसमें जरूर मैं उसको एनालिसिस करता रहता हूं। क्योंकि चंद्रमा 24 घंटे में चार बार अह नक्षत्र बदलता है। अह अह नक्षत्र पद बदलता है। राशि अह में ट्रांजिट करता है। हर हफ्ते में एक बार। जैसे यहां पर मकर राशि में आएंगे। मकर के बाद कुंभ में आएंगे। मीन में रहेंगे। लेकिन चंद्रमा के नक्षत्र पद बदलने का भी अपना एक इंपैक्ट रहता है। कहां पर जा रहे हैं? किस समय जा रहे हैं। उस समय बाजार में क्या वोलेटिलिटी रहती है वह अपना एक अलग उसका विषय रहता है। लेकिन अगला हफ्ता पिछले हफ्ते के के की तरह ही वोलेटाइल रहने वाला है। ज्यादातर दबाव में रहेगा बाजार। इसलिए मुझे लगता है कि जो बाजार में काम कर रहे हैं उन्हें काफी सावधान रहना पड़ेगा। बाकी यह जो वीडियो है यह ट्रेडिंग के लिए सलाह नहीं है। यह आपकी जानकारी भर के लिए है। कोई भी आप निवेश करते हैं गोल्ड या सिल्वर में, तो अपने निवेश सलाहकार की मदद जरूर लीजिए। इस वीडियो को देखकर किसी भी तरह की निवेश के का निर्णय जो है वह आप नहीं

  "wR0weEJS9dY": "सबसे बड़ा जो ट्रांजिट है वो गुरु का ट्रांजिट है। अब बहुत से लोग कहेंगे कि गुरु तो अपनी ही राशि में है। लेकिन आपने मुझे कहा कि अतिचरी है। तो यह जो गुरु का ट्रांजिट है ये क्या हमें बचाएगा नहीं ऐसी कंडीशन से ऐसी सिचुएशन से क्योंकि गुरु को सबसे ब्लेसिंग देने वाला प्लनेट कहा गया है। जी हां जो गुरु हैं सबसे शुभ ग्रह हैं। वह अपने शुभ प्रभावों से दूसरे ग्रहों की नेगेटिविटी को अह मिनिमाइज कर लेते हैं। लेकिन गुरु खुद अतिचारी हैं। कभी वो सीधे चलते हैं, कभी रिवर्स चलते हैं। यानी गुरु भी कंफ्यूज्ड है। हम्म। अब गुरु कृपा शिष्यों पे आती है। शिष्य गुरु से कोई बात करके ज्ञान लेना चाहते हैं, तो गुरु कहते हैं, हटो मैं जल्दी में हूं। फिर बात करेंगे। यानी गुरु और शिष्यों के बीच का कनेक्शन और संबंध हो ही नहीं पा रहा। वो ज्ञान का आदान प्रदान ही नहीं हो पा रहा। तो गुरु भी बिल्कुल जो है हेल्पलेस हैं। वो भी जो सहयोग उनसे मिलना चाहिए शिष्यों को वो नहीं मिल पाएगा। कर्क में रहेंगे अपनी राशि में 2 जून से लेके एंड ऑफ अक्टूबर तक लेकिन 18 जून से वो अतिचारी हो जाएंगे। नव ग्रहों में सबसे शुभ ग्रह गुरु है और यह पांच हरों का तो साक्षात कारक है। जिसकी कुंडली में गुरु अच्छा होता है। उसके जीवन का लगभग हर क्षेत्र अच्छा चलता है। हर पहलू अच्छा होता है। सो ही एक्सेल इन ऑल वर्क्स ऑफ़ लाइफ। लेकिन इस समय गुरु खुद ही अतिचारी है। बहुत तेज गति से चल रहे हैं। जो राशि वह 12 13 महीनों में कवर करते हैं वो पांच महीने में कर रहे हैं। इतनी तेजी से भाग रहे हैं जैसे वो खुद घबराए हुए और डरे हुए हैं। तो जब शिष्य उनसे कुछ बात करना चाहते हैं यानी दूसरे ग्रह चाहते हैं कि उनकी कृपा आए। उनकी दृष्टि आए। दृष्टि आए कैसे? वह इतनी तेजी से चल रहे हैं संपर्क हो नहीं पाता। तो जो गुरु के शुभ फल मिलने हैं वह 2026 में हमको नहीं मिल पा रहे हैं और यह गुरु अतिचारी अगले छ सात साल के लिए हैं। तो यह समस्याएं बनी रहेंगी और गुरु जब सिंह राशि में प्रवेश करेंगे अक्टूबर 2026 के एंड में सिंह राशि में भी गुरु कोई बहुत अच्छे फल नहीं दे पाते और जाते ही उनकी मुलाकात केतु से होगी सिंह राशि में और सामने से राहु की दृष्टि आ जाएगी और ये रहेगी 5 दिसंबर तक 5 दिसंबर को वो राशि परिवर्तित कर करने वाले हैं राहु और केतु तो इस तरह जो मैं देख रहा हूं मुंडेन अफेयर में ग्रहों की जो स्थितियां हैं टाइम टू टाइम जो चतुरग्रही पंचग्रही कॉम्बिनेशन बन रहे हैं कभी राहु के साथ कभी केतु के साथ कभी शनि के साथ कभी सम सप्तक कभी षडाष्टक और यह जो ग्रहण लग रहे हैं बड़े तो इन सब को देखते हुए यह पूरा साल मुझे डिस्टर्ब नजर आता है। सारे देशाध्यक्ष दिशाहीन हो जाएंगे। आपको न्यू वर्ल्ड, न्यू स्ट्रेटजी ऑर्डर, न्यू इकोनमी ऑर्डर देखने को मिलेंगे। और अगर युद्ध हो गया सोने चांदी के भाव तो बढ़ेंगे मेटल के लेकिन जो शेयर बाजार है वो नीचे आएगा लेकिन खाने-पीने की वस्तुओं की शॉर्टेज हो सकती है। उनके भाव बढ़ेंगे। महंगाई बढ़ेगी। तो ये अगर बुद्धिमता से नहीं चलते हैं देशाध्यक्ष और जो राजा हैं तो ये राजा का वर्ष है। ईगो क्लेश बहुत है और कुछ भी जो है वो संसार के लिए बुरे से बुरा हो सकता है। सर ये तो हमने एक ग्लोबल लेवल पे बात की। अब मैं इंडिया के लिए भी कुछ मेजर प्रेडिक्शनंस आपसे जानना चाहूंगी थोड़ा और डिटेल में कि यह जो ग्रहों के ट्रांजिट हो रहे हैं ये इंडिया के लिए क्या कुछ लेकर आने वाले हैं। आपने जैसे स्टॉक मार्केट की बात की। यहां भी क्या कुछ उतार-चढ़ाव होगा इंडिया के? देखिए अभी जो स्टॉक मार्केट है वो जो है स्टॉक स्पेसिफिक हो गई है और जो है साइडवेज हो गई है। 2026 में भी आप स्टॉक मार्केट में कोई बड़ा एक्सपेक्टेशन नहीं रख सकते हैं। आप जो अपनी इन्वेस्टमेंट है स्प्रेड करके लगाइए। गोल्ड में, सिल्वर में, स्टक्स में, अच्छे में और म्यूचल फंड्स में अपने आपको सेफ रखिए। बफर ज़ोन में रखिए। बफर ज़ोन ये होता है कि आप इस तरह से उसको डिस्ट्रीब्यूट करके करें कि कोई भी छ फैक्टर होते है, कहीं बहुत ज्यादा लॉसेस होते हैं। कहीं कुछ प्रॉफिट होता है। मतलब वो एटलीस्ट आपके बेसिक लेवल से नीचे नहीं जाए। तो इस तरह से है कि फ्लक्चुएशंस बहुत हैं। अनसर्टेनिटीज बहुत है। जी। और जो मैं भारत के लिए देख रहा हूं कि भारत में जो मैंने बताया आपको कि ये मकर संक्रांति है। जी और जो नई संवत शुरू होगी रौद्र ये इतनी फेवरेबल नहीं है। इसमें जो राजा है वो गुरु है। मंत्री मंगल है। शशेष गुरु है। धनेश बुध है। मेघेश चंद्र है। और रशेष शनि है। दुर्गेश भी चंद्र है। यानी ग्रह मंडल के राजा सूर्य को इसमें कोई रोल ही नहीं मिला है। जबकि न्यूमेरो से देखते हैं। ये एक नंबर का राजा का वर्ष है। तो ये विरोधाभास है। और ये जो ग्रहण लग रहे हैं। ये हमारे भारत को भी अफेक्ट करेंगे। और ये जो आपका संवत शुरू हो रहा है रौद्र तो हमारी भी जो घटनाएं दुर्घटनाएं हैं मार्च, अप्रैल, मई, जून बहुत सेंसिटिव है। कोई बड़ा युद्ध हमें लड़ना पड़ सकता है। आतंकवादी घटनाएं हो सकती हैं। प्राकृतिक प्राकृति रौद्र रूप धारण करेगी। हम्म। ये सारी समस्याएं देश में है क्योंकि आस्तीन के सांप देश में भी बहुत हैं और विदेश में भी बहुत हैं। हमारे पड़ोसी देश की हालत आपको पता ही है और ये बड़ा दुखद है। कुछ दिन पहले हमने देखा सुना कि दिल्ली में लाल किले के पास एक आतंकवादी हमला हुआ। शाम के समय कार में बम फटे हैं। अभी जो भी उसकी डिटेल पता लगेगी। कुछ काफी लोग मर गए हैं। 10 12 की गिनती सुनी थी। 30-40 घायल हुए हैं। एग्जैक्ट गिनती तो टाइम लगता है और बहुत सी कारें उड़ गई हैं। बहुत सा नुकसान हुआ है। और ये आतंकवादी कोई जाहिल नहीं थे। पढ़े लिखे डॉक्टर हैं ये। जी। और बहुत ज्यादा विस्फोटक बारूद, फरीदाबाद और इस क्षेत्र में डॉक्टर्स हैं वो लोग। या और डॉक्टर की पढ़ाई जो करते हैं उनका काम होता है जीवन दान देना जीवन की रक्षा करना ये वो शपथ लेते हैं और ये बड़ा विचित्र है कि वो डॉक्टर की पढ़ाई करके मासेकर करने के लिए बम और विस्फोटक लेके बैठे हैं। ये बड़ा दुखद है मानव जाति के लिए। इस तरह की कोई सोच होनी ही नहीं चाहिए। आप देख रहे हैं इस तरह की और यह शुरुआत हो चुकी है। और अगला साल जो मुझे दिखता है वो डिस्टर्ब दिखता है। भारत के लिए भी बहुत अच्छा नहीं है। क्योंकि जो ग्रहों के कॉम्बिनेशन बन रहे हैं जो हमारी मकर संक्रांति कह रही है। मैंने कहा ना उच्च नीच वर्ग में एक तरह का जो है विरोधाभास और मनमुटाव बढ़ेगा। दूरी बढ़ेगी। ये उच्च वर्ग के लिए हानिकारक है। निम्न वर्ग के लिए लाभदायक है। और फिर जो रौद्र नामक संवत चेंज होगा उसमें भी मैंने बताया महंगाई बढ़ेगी। खतरा बढ़ेगा देश के लिए क्योंकि राजा तो कहीं वहां है ही नहीं ना। और अगर जो वर्ष का राजा है वो बृहस्पति है। बृहस्पति तो खुद ही अतिचारी चल रहा है। जब वो खुद अतिचारी है तो वो क्या मदद कर पाएगा? यानी राजा के लिए भारत के राजा के लिए भी बहुत विषम परिस्थितियां होंगी सर अति बहुत चैलेंजिंग होंगी सर अतिचारी तो मतलब बस मूवमेंट फास्ट हुआ है ना जी हां आप बहुत तेज दौड़ रही हैं जोगिंग कर रही हैं किसी से बात कर सकती हैं पॉसिबल है नो कम्युनिकेशन बंद हो गया ना यानी आपसे किसी को कोई सजेशन या हेल्प मिलने में पॉसिबल ही नहीं बिल्कुल वही बात है प्रकृति में जो ग्रहों की प्रकृति है वो मानव पे पूरी तरह एप्लीकेबल होती है यत पिंड तत ब्रह्मांड यस तो पूरी वही है जो हमारा नेचर है बिहेवियर है सारा ग्रहों से कंट्रोल है। जी तो अगले साल जो भारत के लिए कोई बहुत अच्छा साल नहीं कहा जा सकता। हां मैं मैं यही कहूंगा कि हमारी जो सरकार है जो राजा हैं वो बहुत सजग हैं। बहुत कैपेबल हैं और उन्होंने प्रूव किया हर तरह की परिस्थितियों को उन्होंने नियंत्रित किया है और वो विषम परिस्थितियों को फिर से पूरी तरह से कंट्रोल करने के लिए और नियंत्रण में ना लाने के लिए राइट डायरेक्शन पे ले जाने के लिए पूर्णत सक्षम है। सिर्फ इतना है कि उनको भी अपनी सुरक्षा और ज्यादा मजबूत करनी चाहिए और ज्यादा अलर्ट होना चाहिए और पड़ोसी देशों से और जो घर के अंदर आस्तीन के सांप हैं उनप कड़ी नजर रखनी चाहिए। जी",
  "Jsuan_n-hOw": "बड़े-बड़े मुल्क युद्ध में उलझे हुए हैं और युद्ध यकीनन कहीं पर जाकर खत्म नहीं होता है। अगर उसको रोकने की कोशिश नहीं की जाए तो वह अपने साथ तबाही लेकर आता है। बर्बादी लेकर आता है। मानवता के लिए खतरा है। ऐसे में युद्ध की बात करते हुए पंडित राजकुमार शास्त्री जी रूस यूक्रेन का युद्ध इज़राइल हमास का देखें। भारतपाकिस्तान के बीच हाल में जो हुआ उसके बाद ऑपरेशन सिंदूर में भी हमने देखा उसको मात देते हुए पाकिस्तान को कई मोर्चों पर दुनिया अलग-अलग जगहों पर युद्ध में उलझी हुई है। 2026 युद्ध के लिहाज से क्या संकेत कर रहा है? देखिएित्रा जी युद्ध पर एक बहुत बड़ा ज्योतिष गणित है और प्रत्यक्षम ज्योतिषम शास्त्रम चंद्रारको यत्र साक्षिणा ज्योतिष शास्त्र प्रत्यक्ष शास्त्र है और इसकी भविष्यवाणियां लगभग सत्य होती हैं। लेकिन मंगल और शुक्र की युति यह विपरीत योग का निर्माण करती है। इस स्थिति में युद्ध बंद होने की कोई गुंजाइश नहीं है। इसके बाद आगे राहु और मंगल का योग जो बन रहा है बृहसद संिता के अनुसार राहु अंगार कश्यव एक रासौ गता यदि महाभयंम च कलहम रोग शोक प्रजायते किसी बहुत बड़े रोग का योग उत्पन्न कर सकता है। बहुत बड़े तृतीय विश्व युद्ध की तरफ अगर तृतीय विश्व युद्ध नहीं तो उसके जैसा ही योग निर्माण हो सकता है। और शोक प्रजा इस प्रकार से परस्पर द्वंद की स्थिति बनी रहेगी। भारत अमेरिका के संबंधों में सुधार होगा। वहीं पड़ोसी देशों के साथ में पाकिस्तान, चाइना, बांग्लादेश, श्रीलंका यहां के साथ में कोई ना कोई पड़ोसी देश भारत के साथ में छेड़खानी करके अशांति उत्पन्न करने का प्रयास कर सकता है। भारत की साख बढ़ेगी। जी यह महत्वपूर्ण जानकारी आपने दी है। यकीनन अह युद्ध को लेकर तमाम देश अलग-अलग मोर्चे पर डटे हुए हैं। लेकिन युद्ध समस्या का समाधान नहीं हो सकता है। तो युद्ध की समाप्ति ही सभी के हित में है। इसको लेकर दुनिया के जो बड़े-बड़े मुल्क हैं अगर आपस में सामंजस्य के हिसाब से फैसले लेंगे तो कहीं ज्यादा बेहतर होगा। आगे बढ़ते हुए आपदा पर आते हुए वान्या आर्या जी सीधे आपसे मेरा यह सवाल है क्योंकि 2025 में हमने अलग-अलग जगहों पर तमाम आपदाएं देखी। लोगों को मरते करोड़ों रुपए स्वाहा देखा। 2026 आपदा के लिहाज से कैसा साल रहने वाला है? देखिए चित्रा जी अगर हम 2026 की बात करते हैं तो प्राकृतिक आपदाएं कंपेरेटिवली 2025 से तो कम होंगी लेकिन इसका अंत कहीं से भी आता नहीं दिखता। एबीपी न्यूज़ के माध्यम से ही हमने ये प्रेडिक्शन की थी कि ये ग्लोबल वार्मिंग का नहीं ग्लोबल बोइलिंग का साल है। तो ये वाला जो अपकमिंग ईयर है ये भी ग्लोबल बोइलिंग का ही साल है। सूर्य जो है वो भी अग्नि तत्व है। फायर एलिमेंट है। तो आप इस साल भी अग्नि घटनाएं देखेंगे। 17 फरवरी जब टोटल सोलर एक्लिप्स होगा। हालांकि ये इंडिया में विज़िबल नहीं है। बट अक्रॉस द ग्लोब वर्ल्ड वाइड आप इसको बहुत ज्यादा आप इसके इंपैक्ट देश में देखेंगे। आप वोल्केनिक इरप्शंस बहुत ज्यादा होंगी। एक्सट्रीम वेरिएशन इन टेंपरेचर ग्लोबल वार्मिंग नहीं बॉईलिंग तो आप देखेंगे बहुत ज्यादा गर्मी बहुत ज्यादा सर्दी या फिर टेंपरेचर में जो है एक्सट्रिमिटीज की सिचुएशंस जो है आपको देखने को मिलेंगी। बाढ़ जो है फ्लड्स बहुत जगह आपको देखने को मिलेंगे। कहीं टेररिस्ट अटैक भी हो सकते हैं। जब भारत की जो है मंगल की महादशा चलेगी। उसमें राहु की अंतरर्दशा रफली 17 फरवरी से लेकर 23 मार्च तक का समय जो है बहुत ज्यादा कठिन है। पूजा भाटिया जी बिना देर किए अब आ जाते हैं अर्थव्यवस्था पर। हिंदुस्तान तो चौथी बड़ी अब अर्थव्यवस्था बन चुका है। तीसरे को लेकर प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी ने बड़े ख्वाब दिखाए हैं हम सबको लाल किले की प्राचर पर जब उन्होंने तिरंगा फहराया था। अर्थव्यवस्था के लिहाज से कैसा रहने वाला है 2026? देखिए अर्थव्यवस्था के लिहाज से अगर मैं भारत की कुंडली देखती हूं तो वृषभ लग्न की कुंडली है और शनि जो है नाइंथ एंड 10थ लॉर्ड होके 12 11थ हाउस में ट्रांजिट कर रहे हैं जो कि लाभ भाव है। वहीं गुरु का गोचर बहुत शुभ है। साल की शुरुआत में लग्न से दूसरे भाव में फिर तीसरे भाव में और चौथे भाव में। तो ओवरऑल भारत की अर्थव्यवस्था ग्लोबल लेवल पर बहुत पॉजिटिव दिख रही है। यहां पे गुरु का गोचर पॉजिटिव है। आप देखिएगा बहुत मेजर फॉरेन कंपनीज़ जो है इंडिया में इन्वेस्ट करती हुई नजर आ रही है। एशिया में बहुत मेजर सिलिकॉन वैली प्रोजेक्ट बनेगा जिसमें भारत से ही शुरुआत होगी। और आप यह देखना कि एआई की वजह से आप देखिएगा बहुत मेजर यहां पे हमें इशूज़ देखने को मिल रहे हैं। बहुत मेजर लेआउ्स भी हो सकते हैं एआई की वजह से। और एआई के कुछ ऐसे इंस्टेंसेस होंगे जो ह्यूमन पे बहुत मेजर इंपैक्ट डालते हुए नजर आ रहे हैं। वहीं जब शनि का नक्षत्र परिवर्तन होगा तो उस टाइम पे करेंसी में आप फ्लक्चुएशनंस देखेंगे। प्राइम मिनिस्टर नरेंद्र मोदी जो है करेंसी को लेके कुछ मेजर डिसीजंस ले सकते हैं। हो सकता है नोटबंदी की भी यहां पे बात चले। अगर हम सेक्टर्स की पर्टिकुलरली बात करें तो हेल्थ केयर सेक्टर बहुत बूम करेगा। फार्मा सेक्टर बहुत बूम करेगा। और इसके साथ स्टॉक मार्केट की यदि मैं बात करती हूं तो स्टॉक मार्केट में जिस तरह से गुरुदेव बृहस्पति अर्धचारी हैं और जब-जब गुरु देव बृहस्पति का राशि परिवर्तन होगा तब-तब स्टॉक मार्केट में आप मेजर फ्लक्चुएशंस देखेंगे। प्लस माइनस वन मंथ कर लेती हूं जून और अक्टूबर में तब आप स्टॉक मार्केट में मेजर फ्लक्चुएशनंस देखेंगे। हमारी डिफेंस जो है वो काफी स्ट्रांग होती हुई नजर आ रही है और भारत जो है हर तरह की चीज के लिए तैयार होता हुआ नजर आ रहा है। तो नोटबंदी अब नहीं हो बाकी तो सारी चीजें अर्थव्यवस्था हमारी मजबूत रहे जो भी फैसला प्रधानमंत्री केंद्र सरकार ले। डॉक्टर तोशिका रिजोरा जी आपके पास आते हुए सोना चांदी महिलाओं का फेवरेट सब्जेक्ट होता है। लेकिन आजकल इसके बारे में बातचीत करते हुए पहले अपनी जेब टटोल लेनी पड़ती है कि हम खरीदने के लिए जाएं या नहीं जाए। इतनी महंगाई सोना और चांदी दोनों के रेट में जिस तरह का हाइप हमने देखा है तो 2026 में जरा बताइए खरीदने लायक स्थिति बनेगी या फिर और महंगाई देखिए जिनको खरीदना है उनके लिए तो बिल्कुल स्थितियां बनेगी 2026 में जो है सोना और ज्यादा बूम होता हुआ यहां पे नजर आ रहा है। आप देखेंगे कि रेट्स जो है ना केवल फिजिकली मैं यहां पे बोलूंगी कि शेयर मार्केट स्टॉक मार्केट के लिहाज से जो है काफी ज्यादा बूम आएगा। लोग जो है गोल्ड जो इंडस्ट्रीज हैं उसमें काफी इन्वेस्ट करते हुए नजर आ रहे हैं 2026 में और सिल्वर भी आप देखेंगे कि सिल्वर भी एकदम से डाउन आएगा उसके बाद एकदम से दोबारा से बूम करता हुआ नजर आएगा 2026 का सेकंड हाफ जो है वो क्लियरली ये दर्शाता है कि सोना और चांदी काफी ज्यादा बूम करेगा काफी ज्यादा इनक्रीस होगा लेकिन एक चीज मैं यहां पे बोलूंगी जो भी लोग यह सोच रहे हैं कि जिनके पास भी सोना है या वह सोच रहे हैं कि हम 2026 में जो है उसको हेरफेर कर ले तो बिल्कुल भी मत करिएगा क्योंकि 2027 का एंड और 28 का जो बिगिनिंग होगा वो सोना पीक पे जाता हुआ यहां पे नजर आ रहा है और आप स्थितियां देखेंगे कि इंडस्ट्रीज जो है काफी ज्यादा बेटर परफॉर्म करेंगी गोल से रिलेटेड इनफैक्ट स्टॉक मार्केट में जैसे कि मैंने अभी बोला लोग इन्वेस्ट करते हुए बॉन्ड्स खरीदते हुए शेयर्स खरीदते हुए नजर आ रहे हैं जिससे काफी लाभ होगा यह आपको सात से आठ महीने में ही देखेगा कि एकदम एकदम चीजें पल पलटती हुई पॉजिटिवली आपको बढ़ती हुई यहां पे नजर आएंगी। ट्रेडिंग जो है काफी बढ़ती हुई नजर आ रही है 2026 में। भारत के लिहाज से अगर हम ओवरऑल देखें तो यह साल तो आप लगा लीजिए कि महंगाई तो बढ़ेगी। महंगाई जितनी भी बढ़े लोगों की जेब में पैसे उतनी ही तेजी से आए तो मुझे लगता है कि शायद ज्यादा बेहतर स्थिति रहेगी और 2026 हम सबके लिए खूब सारा सोना चांदी लेकर आए। खूब सारी तरक्की लेकर आए। लोगों के चेहरे पर मुस्कान, लोगों के लिए अच्छा स्वास्थ्य, भारत के लिए तेज गति की तरक्की ताकि हम दुनिया की टॉप तीन अर्थव्यवस्था में जाकर शामिल हो पाए। [संगीत] एबीपी न्यूज़ आपको रखे आगे।",

  "E0fXSzLeh2w": "नमस्कार। फर्स्ट जनवरी से नव वर्ष की शुरुआत होती है। ऐसा यूनिवर्सली हम सब ने कई सालों से मान के रखा है। भले ही वैदिक या हिंदू नव वर्ष की शुरुआत चैत्र शुक्ल प्रतिपदा से होती है लेकिन फिर भी 1 जनवरी 2026 से लेकर 31 दिसंबर 2026 का जो समय है जिसको हम 2026 कहते हैं उसके बीच क्या हो सकता है वह वैदिक एस्ट्रोलॉजी के माध्यम से जाना जा सकता है और वही करने का यह प्रयास है। वराह मिहिर जी ने एक एस्ट्रोलॉजर में क्या गुण होने चाहिए वह समझाते हुए ऐसा स्पष्ट कहा है कि एक एस्ट्रोलॉजर को देश काल के अनुसार एक्सपेरिमेंट करने से डरना नहीं चाहिए। उनका स्पष्ट सूत्र है तत्र संवत्सरो अभिजात प्रिय दर्शनो विनीत वेश देश काल विते सात्विको न परिषद भरूहु सो फर्स्ट जनवरी 2026 से लेकर 31 दिसंबर 2026 का समय अर्थात वर्ष 2026 कैसा रहेगा वह वैदिक ज्योतिष के माध्यम से समझाने का मैं प्रयास करूंगा। सो फर्स्ट जनवरी 202601 पर क्या कुंडली बनती है वह सर्वप्रथम हम देखेंगे और उसके आधार पर 2026 में क्या हो सकता है वह प्रेडिक्शन देखेंगे। यदि हम फर्स्ट जनवरी 202601 की कुंडली को निकालते हैं तो कई देशों की कुंडली में हम यह देखते हैं कि कन्या लग्न आ रहा है और लग्न का स्वामी बुध फोर्थ हाउस में सूर्य, मंगल, शुक्र के साथ चतुर ग्रही योग बना रहा है। अब यह जो योग जो बन रहा है, वह एक तरह से इंटरेस्टिंग योग बन रहा है। इतना ही नहीं बुध और गुरु इस कुंडली में राशि परिवर्तन कर रहे हैं और इसको शास्त्रों में एक महा राजयोग कारक परिवर्तन योग कहा गया है। सो बहुत सारी पॉजिटिव इवेंट्स 2026 में होने वाली है। यदि उसी कुंडली को देखें तो फर्स्ट हाउस, फोर्थ हाउस, सेवंथ हाउस और 10थ हाउस एवं नवम स्थान में उच्च का चंद्र होने के कारण मानवतावादी कार्य ह्यूमेनिटेरियन वर्क्स या पब्लिक वेलफेयर के कई कर्म इस वर्ष किए जाएंगे। इनफ्लेशन इस साल थोड़ा कंट्रोल में रहेगा। रियलस्टेट में ग्लोबली अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग में बूम आता दिख रहा है। बहुत सारे लोगों को अपना घर मिलेगा। एग्रीकल्चर में सस्टेनेबल फूड प्रोडक्शन में इनोवेशन आता हुआ स्पष्ट दिख रहा है। हालांकि यूएस डॉलर के लिए यह समय चैलेंजिंग रहने वाला है। न्यू ग्लोबल करेंसी के ऊपर डिबेट होगी और शायद यूएस डॉलर के सामने कोई अल्टरनेट ग्लोबल रिजर्व इकॉनमी की डिमांड एक्टिव हो जाएगी और शायद उसका जो पहला स्टेप है वह 2026 में होगा। शायद गोल्ड को न्यू ग्लोबल करेंसी के साथ जोड़ा जाए और उसके कारण गोल्ड की प्राइस अभी जिस लेवल पर है उससे कई गुना ज्यादा बढ़ जाएगी ऐसा स्पष्ट दिख रहा है। 2026 में स्टॉक मार्केट से कई गुना ज्यादा रिटर्न गोल्ड सिल्वर या प्रेसियस में मेटल्स में मिलेगा। ऐसा सभी एक्सपर्ट्स का मानना है। बैंकिंग सिस्टम में 2026 में ज्यादा स्टेबिलिटी आएगी। ज्यादा रिफॉर्म्स आएंगे। साइबर सिक्योरिटी के ऊपर नए लॉस आएंगे। यदि जॉब मार्केट की बात करूं तो इंस्टेड ऑफ टेक्नोलॉजी और एआई इमोशनल इंटेलिजेंस, ईक्यू, एल्डर केयर, समाज कल्याण, होम सिक्योरिटी इन सेक्टर में जो लोग जॉब कर रहे हैं उन सबको ज्यादा रिवॉर्ड मिलेगा। उनको ज्यादा ग्रोथ मिलेगा। न्यू ईयर की कुंडली में फोर्थ हाउस में चार प्लनेट्स होना वह भी एक तरह से बॉर्डर डिस्प्यूट्स सरफेस पर आएंगे देशों के बीच ऐसा दिख रहा है। हमारा देश पहले फिर विश्व नेशन फर्स्ट देन ग्लोब ऐसा अप्रोच सभी नेशंस करते रहेंगे। यह चतुरग्रही योग धन राशि में हो रहा है जो कि धर्म की राशि है। अग्नि तत्व की राशि है। सो धार्मिक रेडिकल ग्रुप्स इस समय के दौरान एक्टिवेट हो गए और शायद किसी नेता के धार्मिक नेता के भड़काऊ भाषण के कारण टेररिस्ट अटैक हो और धर्म युद्ध जैसा माहौल क्रिएट होता हुआ दिख रहा है। क्योंकि अग्नित्व डेवलप हो रहा है। तो इसी 2026 में आग लगने की कई इवेंट्स होगी। कई फॉरेस्ट हम देखेंगे कि आग के कारण जल के एक तरह से खाक हो गए और उसके कारण पूरे विश्व का जो टेंपरेचर है वह इस वर्ष थोड़ा और बढ़ेगा। ऐसा स्पष्ट दिख रहा है। आर्ट, म्यूजिक, जुडिशियल और एजुकेशन सिस्टम में बहुत ज्यादा रिफॉर्म्स आते हुए स्पष्ट दिख रहे हैं। अब ये जो सूर्य, बुध, मंगल और शुक्र ये चार ग्रहों की जो युति हो रही है, उस युति को यदि हम थोड़ा और ज्यादा ज़ूम इन करके देखें तो ऐसा दिख रहा है दैट इस समय में शनि भले सप्तम हाउस में है, लेकिन अपनी 10थ आस्पेक्ट से इन चारों ग्रहों को देख रहा है। और गुरु अपने सेवंथ आस्पेक्ट से इन चारों ग्रहों को देख रहा है। सो कुल मिला के यदि हम देखें तो धन राशि में छह ग्रहों की एनर्जी कंसंट्रेट हो रही है। अब इस तरह के कॉम्बिनेशंस को शास्त्रों में अच्छा नहीं माना गया है। यह जो चतुरग्रही योग है जो जनवरी में हो रहा है ऐसा नहीं है। आगे जाकर फरवरी में भी होगा और मार्च में भी होगा और उसके कारण धन राशि, मकर राशि और कुंभ राशि में भी यह चतुर ग्रही योग रिपीट होने वाला है। अब इस नेगेटिव ग्रह योग के बारे में बात करते हुए महर्षि नारद ने और मयूर चित्रक में यह श्लोक दिया गया है। एक राशो यदा चत्वार पंचखेचरा प्लावयंती महिम सर्वा रुधरेण जलेनवा अर्थात यह चतुरग्रही योग के कारण पृथ्वी पर बहुत सारे वॉर्स होते हैं। बहुत सारे लोगों की जान जाती है और एक तरह से मानव के लहू का फ्लड आता है। इतना ही नहीं सुनामी और फ्लड्स के कारण बहुत सारे प्रदेश जल के अंदर डूब जाते हैं। आइदर ब्लड के कारण या फिर वाटर के कारण पृथ्वी तकलीफ में रहती है। ऐसा स्पष्ट कहा गया है। अब यह जो नेचुरल केमिटी है या वॉर है वह पूरे विश्व में ना होते हुए कहां पर होने की संभावना ज्यादा है वह भी शास्त्र दर्शा रहा है कुर्म चक्र के सिद्धांत के आधार पर और स्पष्ट सूत्र भी दिए गए हैं। सो एशियन कंट्रीज लाइक इंडिया, इंडोनेशिया, चाइना, रशिया, पाकिस्तान, सऊदी अरेबिया, अफ्रीकन कंट्रीज लाइक नाइजीरिया, इथोपिया, इजिप्ट, टंजनिया, यूरोप की कुछ कंट्रीज लाइक इटली, स्पेन, यूक्रेन, पोलैंड और ग्रीस एवं ऑस्ट्रेलिया और न्यूजीलैंड इन सब में यह नेचुरल कैलिमिटीज या वॉर होने की संभावना है। अब इसमें भी ज्यादा जब ज़ूम इन करते हैं तो स्पेन, सऊदी अरेबिया, हंगरी, मडागास्कर और ऑस्ट्रेलिया में सुनामी या फ्लड के कारण काफी लोगों की जान जाती हुई हमें स्पष्ट दिख रही है। अब इस सूत्र को थोड़ा और ज्यादा समझते हुए हम थोड़ा और ज़ूम इन करके बात को समझे तो तीन चार बातें और स्पष्ट हो जाती है। उसमें सबसे पहली बात यह स्पष्ट हो रही है कि रशिया यूक्रेन का वॉर जो कि काफी समय से चल रहा है वह इस समय के दौरान 2026 में और ज्यादा इंटेंस होगा। कुछ और कंट्रीज इसमें इनवॉल्व होगी और वर्ल्ड वॉर थ्री जैसी परिस्थितियां निर्मित होती हुई स्पष्ट दिख रही है। मई 2026 के बाद पूरा विश्व न्यूक्लियर वॉर के डर में जिएगा। शायद कहीं पर कोई न्यूक्लियर अटैक कोई देश दूसरे देश के ऊपर कर भी दे। किसी बड़े नेता की अपमृत्यु यासिनेशन के कारण युद्ध और इंटेंस होता हुआ स्पष्ट दिख रहा है। अब 9 वर्ष की कुंडली को थोड़ा और समझे। थोड़ा और ज्यादा ज़ूम इन करें। डिकोड करके यदि भारत देश में स्पेसिफिकली क्या हो सकता है? उसकी बात करें तो उसके लिए वर्ष प्रबोध में बहुत सूत्र दिए गए हैं जो यहां पर मैं संक्षिप्त में देना चाहूंगा। कन्यायाम सुस्थिति ही प्राच्य ध्रुते चेव महरदता अर्थात ईस्टर्न पार्ट ऑफ द इंडिया अर्थात बिहार झारखंड उड़ीसा वेस्ट बंगाल में लोग खुश होंगे वहां पर महंगाई बढ़ेगी। मारी दक्षिण देश तथा वंगेप उपद्रव अर्थात बंगाल में उपद्रव प्रोटेस्ट और कम्युनल रायड्स होंगे। 2026 में वेस्ट बंगाल को या बंगाल को हम बहुत सारे दिनों न्यूज़ में देखेंगे। वहां पर कम्युनल रायट्स भी होंगे, प्रोटेस्ट भी होगा और एक तरह से पिटिकल स्टेबिलिटी हम डगमगाती हुई देखेंगे। सदर्न स्टेट्स लाइक आंध्र प्रदेश, कर्नाटक, केरल, तमिलनाडु, तेलंगाना में महामारी अर्थात पेंडेमिक्स का डर बना रहेगा। कोई ऐसा कोई डिसीज होगा जो इनफेशियस होगा और उसके कारण पूरे सदर्न स्टेट्स में एक तरह का डर बना रहेगा। अब पश्चिम में क्या हो सकता है उसके बारे में बात करते हुए यह सूत्र यह कहता है लोक दुख पश्च मायाम विग्रहो अन्न समर्थता वेस्टर्न स्टेट्स लाइक गुजरात महाराष्ट्र गोवा राजस्थान में लोगों को दुख मिलता है। प्रजा नाख रहती है। पॉलिटिकल अनरेस्ट इंटरनल कॉन्फ्लिक्ट और कम्युनल राइट्स बना रहता है। नॉर्दन स्टेट्स लाइक उत्तर प्रदेश, हरियाणा, पंजाब, हिमाचल प्रदेश, जम्मू कश्मीर ले लद्दाख में क्या होगा वह दर्शाते हुए यह सूत्र दिया गया है। उदि्याम राज विग्रह अर्थात इस स्टेट्स में सत्ता परिवर्तन और इंटरनल पार्टी कॉन्फ्लिक्ट्स होते हुए स्पष्ट दिख रहे हैं। भारत के गृह मंत्रालय एवं गृह मंत्री के लिए यह वर्ष चैलेंजिंग रहेगा। शायद उनकी हेल्थ में कुछ कॉम्प्लिकेशन हो या फिर उनकी प्रतिष्ठा के ऊपर कोई दाग लगे उस तरह के ग्रह योग दिख रहे हैं। इसके अलावा मिनिस्ट्री ऑफ एग्रीकल्चर, हाउसिंग, माइंस और डिजास्टर भी एक्टिवेट रहेगी। वहां भी बहुत सारी उथल-पुथल होती हुई स्पष्ट दिख रही है। इंडियन इकॉनमी के लिए एवं स्टॉक मार्केट के लिए यह समय माइनर करेक्शन के साथ पॉजिटिव होता हुआ दिख रहा है। यह जो कुंडली बन रही है उस कुंडली में फोर्थ हाउस और 10थ हाउस का परिवर्तन योग होने के कारण भले ही अपोजिशन के द्वारा बहुत सारे प्रयास किए जाएंगे, लेकिन फिर भी यह जो गवर्नमेंट है, वह गवर्नमेंट स्टेबल रहेगी। सेंट्रल गवर्नमेंट के लिए यह समय पॉजिटिव रहने वाला है। अंत में 2026 हम सबके जीवन में सुख, शांति और समृद्धि लाए। ऐसी ईश्वर को प्रार्थना करके मेरी वाणी को मैं विराम दूंगा। शुभम भवतु प्रणाम।",

तो वीडियो देखने के बाद इस इसमें एक राय बनाइएगा। फाइनल राय बनाइएगा कि आपको उस सेक्टर में जाना चाहिए या नहीं जाना चाहिए। तो खैर क्योंकि जब जब भी हम कोई कैलकुलेशन लेकर आते हैं। खास तौर पर एस्ट्रोलॉजिकल कैलकुलेशन तो पुराना रेफरेंस हम साथ में जरूर लेके आते हैं ताकि थोड़ा सा वीडियो के ऊपर ट्रस्ट बने। तो शनि जब तक अह मकर में और कुंभ में थे तो रियलिटी सेक्टर ने बहुत अच्छा किया था क्योंकि शनि रियलिटी के कारक हैं। अपनी मू त्रिकोण राशि में थे। मेटल्स ने भी ने भी अच्छा किया था तो अह उसके रिजल्ट उस तरीके से देखने को मिले थे। अब शनि मीन राशि में है तो शनि जब मीन राशि में है तो मीन राशि में शनि का फल क्या होता है? यह एक्चुअल में तो शनि ढाई साल रहते हैं। पिछले अब अभी इसी साल चेंज हुए हैं। तो लेकिन 2026 में क्या होगा? 2026 में यदि हम इसको कैलकुलेट करेंगे यह वीडियो 2026 के सेक्टर के लिए है। पहली बात तो यह है 19 मार्च 2026 को शाम 6 बज के सुबह 6:53 के आसपास जो है वह नया संवत शुरू हो रहा है। चैत्र मास की प्रतिपदा तिथि सुबह शुरू होगी और उस दिन गुरुवार है। तो गुरुवार है। इसका मतलब यह है कि गुरु जो है वह संवत के राजा हैं। और जब अह सूर्य मेष राशि में अह प्रवेश कर रहे हैं, उस दिन मंगलवार बनता है। और जब सूर्य मेष राशि में प्रवेश करते हैं जो वार उस दिन होता है वो वार अह उसको हम संवत का मंत्री बोलते हैं। तो वो मंगलवार बन रहा है। तो गुरु राजा हैं। मंगल मंत्री हैं। कहने को दोनों मित्र हैं। लेकिन अब जब कुंडली देखते हैं तो कुंडली में स्थिति कुछ ज्यादा खतरनाक नजर आ रही है। यह संवत की कुंडली आपके सामने यह मीन लग्न की पत्रिका निकल रही है। आप देखिए सूर्य चंद्रमा साथ हैं। ऑब्वियसली प्रतिपदा तिथि है तो सूर्य चंद्रमा साथ ही आएंगे लेकिन शनि और शुक्र भी साथ हैं। तो ये केंद्र में क्या हो गया आपके आपके पास? सूर्य, शनि, शुक्र और चंद्रमा एक साथ हो गए। गुरु आपके फोर्थ हाउस में है। केंद्रीय प्रभाव गुरु का अच्छा है। यह स्थिति थोड़ी सी ज्यादा बेटर नजर आती है। लेकिन मंगल राहु का 12व चले जाना और शनि की राशि में चले जाना यह अच्छा नहीं है। यह वैश्विक शांति के लिए अच्छा नहीं है। केतु अभी छठे भाव में आ जाएंगे। तो यह कुंडली जो है वह सारी बन रही है। आपके सामने है। अब इस कुंडली के आधार पर हम कौन से सेक्टर जो है वह आइडेंटिफाई कर सकते हैं। सबसे पहले तो यह देखेंगे। तो मीन राशि क्योंकि जल तत्व की राशि है। जल तत्व की राशि में ज्यादा ग्रह है तो जल तत्व से संबंधित सेक्टर अगले साल भी चलना चाहिए। तो जल तत्व से संबंधित क्या है? पोर्ट है, शिपिंग है, बेवरेजेस है और आपका क्रूड है। क्योंकि शनि और चंद्रमा दोनों से हम क्रूड को देखते हैं। चंद्रमाकि लिक्विड है तो क्रूड और ऑयल से संबंधित सारी कंपनीज़ एडिबल ऑयल हैं। यह सारे हम उससे देखेंगे। मीन राशि से देखेंगे। अब सूर्य जो है वह सोने के कारक है और चांदी शनि जो है वह बेस मेटल्स के कारक है। बेस मेटल्स के कारक शनि का सूर्य के साथ आ जाना अल्टीमेटली मेटल्स में भी तेजी बरकरार रखेगा। मेटल्स में अच्छे रिटर्न 2026 में भी मिलने चाहिए। मंगल राहु का 12व भाव में जाना यह वैश्विक शांति को डिस्टर्ब करने वाला है। यह संवत की कुंडली क्लियर कर रही है कि 12व में अंगारक दोष बन जाना बेसिकली यह हथियारों की होड़ जो है वो शुरू कर देगा। हथियारों की होड़ शुरू करेगा तो फायदा किसको होगा? डिफेंस को। तो पहले छ महीने डिफेंस के ऊपर जरूर नजर रखिए। मैंने एक वीडियो डाला था अपने पेज के ऊपर। डिफेंस का साइकिल कब होता है? और डिफेंस का वो साइकिल होता है 15 जनवरी से लेकर 15 अगस्त के बीच का। तो यहां पर जब संवत की कुंडली बन रही है उसमें मंगल राहु 12 आ रहे हैं। 12 में मंगल राहु का जाना अच्छा नहीं है। गुरु को राहु ने पीड़ित कर दिया यहां पर और गुरु यहां पर कौन सी राशि में बैठे हुए हैं? गुरु यहां पर बैठे हुए हैं बुध की राशि में। तो गुरु बुध की राशि में बैंकिंग चलना चाहिए। बैंकिंग सेक्टर में डिसे बनने चाहिए। बैंकिंग चलना चाहिए। एनबीएफसी चलना चाहिए। पीएसयू चलना चाहिए। आपके रियलिटी सेक्टर चलना चाहिए। चंद्रमा से संबंधित सेक्टर मून से संबंधित सेक्टर चलना चाहिए और साथ में आपका डिफेंस जरूर चलना चाहिए। और चंद्रमाकि केंद्र में है तो आपका फार्मा भी चलना चाहिए। मेडिसिन से संबंधित चीजें चलनी चाहिए। तो यहां पर इन चीजों पर जो है वह खास नजर रखेंगे इस साल के लिए। यानी कि 2026 के लिए तो 26 के लिए यदि हम एस्ट्रोलॉजिकली देखते हैं संवत की कुंडली के लिहाज से देखते हैं तो यह सेक्टर मुझे समझ में आते हैं कि यहां पर चीजें चलनी चाहिए। अब सेक्टर अवॉइड कौन सा करेंगे? शुक्र क्योंकि ज्यादा पीड़ित हो गए हैं तो शुक्र से रिलेटेड एफएमसीजी सेक्टर में कुछ ना कुछ थोड़ा सा हो सकता है कि आपको रिटर्न अच्छे ना मिले। हो सकता है आपको प्राइवेट बैंक्स जो बड़े बैंक हैं वहां पर आपको अच्छे रिजल्ट ना मिले। ऐसा संभव है कि आपको ब्यूटी लग्जरी एंटरटेनमेंट से संबंधित या रियलिटी जो लग्जरी रियलिटी है उसमें हो सकता है कि कुछ ना कुछ आपको रिटर्न उस प्रकार से ना मिल जाए। लेकिन ओवरऑल रियलिटी चलेगा। ओवरऑल बैंकिंग चलेगा। पीएसयू बैंकिंग चलना चाहिए। यह सेक्टर जो है वो सामने जो नजर आ रहे हैं। एस्ट्रो साइकिल के लिहाज से यदि हम देखते हैं तो ये ये सेक्टर समझ में आते हैं। बाकी अह जो कुंडली बनी है उसमें ज्यादा ग्रह तीन राशियों में आ गए हैं। तो तीनों का डोमिनेंस ज्यादा रहेगा। कुंभ राशि का डोमिनेंस ज्यादा रहेगा। कुंभ राशि से जिन चीजों का विचार करते हैं, मीन राशि से जिन चीजों का विचार करते हैं या मिथुन राशि से जिन चीजों का विचार करते हैं, वहां पर एक्शन ज्यादा होना चाहिए क्योंकि यहां पर ग्रह बैठे हुए हैं। शुभ ग्रह बैठता है तो थोड़ी सी मंदी ले आता है लेकिन पाप ग्रह बैठता है तो वहां पर तेजी ले आता है। तो पाप ग्रह कहां पर बैठे हुए हैं? मीन राशि में बैठे हुए हैं। तो मीन राशि से संबंधित सेक्टर सारे ही चलेंगे। अह कुंभ राशि से संबंधित सेक्टर चलेंगे। कुंभ राशि शनि की राशि है तो शनि से संबंधित सेक्टर रियलिटी चलनी चाहिए। लेबर से संबंधित सेक्टर चलना चाहिए। मेटल चलना चाहिए। इसके साथ-साथ आपको जहां पर अ इंफ्रा कंपनीज़ है सॉरी इंफ्रा कंपनीज़ भी चलनी चाहिए। ये सेक्टर जो है वो इस इसमें संवत में समझ आ रहे हैं। इन सेक्टर पे आपको फोकस रखना चाहिए। बाकी शेयर आप खुद आइडेंटिफाई करेंगे। पिछला वीडियो आप यह जरूर बताइएगा किसने देखा था और उसमें से किसको इसका लाभ मिला है। यह वीडियो आपको कैसा लगा इस पर कमेंट बॉक्स में अपनी राय जरूर दीजिए। यदि यह वीडियो अच्छा लगे तो इसे शेयर जरूर करिए। पेज को सब्सक्राइब जरूर करिए। इसके साथ ही मुझे दीजिए इजाजत। नमस्कार।",
  "Z1q5OnPfTTU": "साल बेवजह की पावर डोमिनेंस किसी भी कंट्री के लिए अच्छी नहीं रहेगी। एक राजा जब डिसीजंस लेता है तो अगर उसके डिसीजन में लॉजिक और बुद्धिमत्ता दिखे तो उसका इंपैक्ट ज्यादा होता है। [संगीत] [संगीत] 25 में तो बहुत ज्यादा फिल्में प्लॉट हो रही है। 2025 एंड तक महाराष्ट्र में बॉलीवुड का समय बहुत खराब चलेगा। अप्रैल 2026 [संगीत] में पूरी दुनिया भारत को टूरिज्म की दृष्टि से। [संगीत] नमस्कार। देखते ही देखते साल 2025 खत्म होने को है और 2026 दस्तक दे रहा है। हर साल हर इंसान के दिमाग में एक-एक क्यूरियोसिटी होती है कि आने वाला साल कैसा रहेगा। आज का वीडियो स्पेशली एस्ट्रोनमोलॉजी की पर्सपेक्टिव से वर्ल्ड और ग्लोबल प्लेटफार्म के लिए कैसा होगा इसे डिकोड करने की कोशिश करेंगे। पिछले साल और आने वाले साल में काफी सिमिलरिटीज हैं। न्यूमरोलॉजी और एस्ट्रोलॉजी दोनों के पर्सपेक्टिव से। पिछला साल 2025 ऐड होता था नंबर नौ पे जो कि था मंगल का साल। और अगर एस्ट्रोलॉजी के पर्सपेक्टिव से देखें तो संवत 2082 में राजा और मंत्री दोनों सूर्य थे। तो अगर एस्ट्रोलॉजी और न्यूमरोलॉजी दोनों को कंबाइन किया जाए तो जो मेजर रोल रहा है दो प्लनेट्स का पिछले साल 2025 में वो बेसिकली सूर्य और मंगल का ही रहा है। आने वाला साल 2026 ऐड होता है नंबर 10 जो कि सूर्य का नंबर है। नंबर 10 1 + 0 अगर करेंगे तो सिंगल नंबर वन आएगा जो कि रूल्ड है सन से। और अगर हम एस्ट्रोलॉजी के पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से देखें तो संवत 2083 जो कि हमारा नया वर्ष हिंदू नव वर्ष की बात हम कर रहे हैं। उसमें आने वाले समय में राजा हैं जुपिटर और मंत्री हैं मंगल। मतलब फिर से न्यूमरोलॉजी और एस्ट्रोलॉजी के पर्सपेक्टिव को मिलाकर अगर कहें तो कहीं ना कहीं सूर्य और मंगल का प्रभुत्व या इंपैक्ट या इन्फ्लुएंस पूरे साल देखने के लिए मिलेगा। लेकिन आखिर यह करेंगे क्या? सूर्य न्यूमरोलॉजी के पर्सपेक्टिव से डिनोट करता है अथॉरिटी, पावर, कॉन्फिडेंस। लेकिन अथॉरिटी और पावर अगर एक पर्टिकुलर लाइन को क्रॉस कर जाए तो वह ईगो में परिवर्तित हो जाती है। 2025 जो कि मंगल से रूल था उसमें आपने पावर स्ट्रगल देखी क्योंकि मंगल का काम ही यही है कि कैसे भी करना है। साम दाम दंड भेद कुछ भी हो उसे अपना काम करना ही है। इसलिए वर्ल्ड प्लेटफार्म पे बहुत सारी कंट्रीज ने पावर स्ट्रगल किया। वह चाहे जायज तरीका हो या जायज तरीका ना हो। एग्जांपल के लिए यूएस ने अपनी सत्ता या अपना डोमिनेंस बरकरार रखने के लिए टेरिफ वॉर किया। टेरिफ गेम खेला। बहुत सारे लोगों को यह पता है कि वह शायद काफी हद तक जायज नहीं था। लेकिन उसे अपनी प्रभुता मेंटेन करने के लिए उसे जो समझ में आया उसने किया। इसे कहते हैं मंगल का प्रभाव। 2026 ऐड हो के आता है नंबर वन सन पे जो कि पावर और डोमिनेंस ही सिग्निफाई करता है। लेकिन यहां पे मंगल और सूर्य के तरीके डिफरेंट होते हैं। इस साल बेवजह की पावर डोमिनेंस किसी भी कंट्री के लिए अच्छी नहीं रहेगी। एक राजा जब डिसीजंस लेता है तो अगर उसके डिसीजन में लॉजिक और बुद्धिमत्ता दिखे तो उसका इंपैक्ट ज्यादा होता है। इस साल भी वर्ल्ड प्लेटफार्म पे ग्लोबल प्लेटफार्म पे पावर स्ट्रगल कंट्रीज का जारी रहेगा। लेकिन इस बार डोमिनेंस वही दिखा पाएगा जो पावर की पॉजिटिव साइड को अप्रोच करेगा। क्योंकि एस्ट्रोलॉजी के हिसाब से साल का राजा जुपिटर है और मंत्री मंगल यह क्लियरली इंडिकेट करता है क्योंकि जुपिटर और मंगल आपस में मित्र हैं। जुपिटर की बुद्धि, गाइडलाइंस, प्रिंसिपल्स को सामने रखते हुए अगर मंगल अपना काम, अपना इंप्लीमेंटेशन करता है तो ही किसी देश की जो सत्ता है या किसी देश का जो लॉजिक है वो बाकी देश एक्सेप्ट करेंगे। पिछले साल की तरह बेवजह का टेरिफ का जो वॉर हुआ है, इस साल ऐसे कोई टैक्टिक्स काम नहीं आएंगे। तो सारी कंट्रीज में सारे जो लीडर्स हैं वह कोशिश करें कि उनके जो डिसीजंस हैं वो प्रैक्टिकल, लॉजिकल और प्रिंसिपल पे बेस्ड हो। क्योंकि हम बात प्रिंसिपल्स की कर रहे हैं। लॉजिक की कर रहे हैं और एक पॉजिटिव पावर के डोमिनेंस की कर रहे हैं। जो कि यूएस करता हुआ नहीं दिख रहा है। तो यूएस का डिक्लाइन इन समवे और द अदर दिखना शुरू हो जाएगा। अब यहां डिक्लाइन का मतलब यह नहीं है कि यूएस की इकॉनमी या यूएस की जो फाइनेंशियल कंडीशन है उसको झटका लगेगा। यूएस की जो एक प्रभुसत्ता एक डेवलप्ड कंट्री एक सुपर पावर की तरह जो उन्होंने अपना डोमिनेंस बना के रखा था ये जो कंटीन्यूअस उनके हेड्स जो डिसीजंस लेंगे उसकी वजह से उनकी जो एक सत्ता है या उनके जो डोमिनेंस है उसको जरूर चोट लगेगी। तो यूएस का डिक्लाइन जरूर होता हुआ दिख रहा है। यह डिक्लाइन किसी बड़े इकोनॉमिकल झटके की तरफ नहीं है। यह डिक्लाइन रेपुटेशन पे है, ट्रस्ट पे है। और यह ट्रस्ट वहां के रहने वाले लोगों का अपनी सरकार पे, अपने देश पे हिलता हुआ दिखेगा और जो बाहर से लोग इस चाह में यूएस जाते हैं कि वहां पे स्टेबिलिटी है, कंफर्ट है। यह सारे भ्रम टूटते हुए दिखेंगे। जो लोग यूएस में रह रहे हैं, वह वापस आते हुए दिखेंगे क्योंकि वहां उन्हें वह इनसिक्योरिटी फील होने लग जाएगी। भारत के लिए 2026 का फर्स्ट हाफ अपने नॉर्मल पेस से चलेगा। लेकिन 2026 का सेकंड हाफ भारत के लिए थोड़ा सा टर्बुलेंट हो सकता है। जब हम सेकंड हाफ की बात कर रहे हैं तो दो चीजें हो रही हैं। एक तो 15th अगस्त के बाद एक चैलेंजिंग ईयर होगा। लेकिन 2027 में एस्ट्रोलॉजी के पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से सैटर्न एरीज की तरफ मूव कर रहा होगा। इसलिए उसका प्रभाव 2026 के सेकंड हाफ में दिखना शुरू हो जाएगा। यह ना सिर्फ भारत के लिए चैलेंजिंग सिचुएशनंस अराइज करता है बल्कि काफी ऐसी सारी चीजें और इवेंट्स को दिखा रहा है जो भारत के लिए ठीक नहीं है। इसे आप चाहे दंगों के रूप में देख लें ग्लोबल प्लेटफार्म पे क्लॉन्फ्लिक्ट के रूप में देख लें या जो भारत का ईस्टर्न साइड है वहां पे कुछ मेजर ट्रबल्स कुछ रायट्स होते हुए दिख रहे हैं। तो सेकंड हाफ चैलेंजिंग होगा भारत के लिए और उससे हमें डील करना पड़ेगा क्योंकि 2026 सूर्य सन का साल होगा न्यूमरोलॉजिकली तो उसका मेटल होगा गोल्ड। गोल्ड लास्ट ईयर भी बहुत अच्छा परफॉर्म कर रहा था। लेकिन अगर आपको लग रहा है कि अभी गोल्ड अपने सैचुरेशन पे पहुंचा है तो ऐसा नहीं है। आने वाले समय में एक नई करेंसी के तौर पे हम गोल्ड को देखेंगे। नई करेंसी का मतलब है कि आप बाकी किसी भी चीज की बात करिए चाहे डॉलर की बात करिए रुपए की बात करिए या किसी इंडस्ट्री की बात करिए उसमें फ्लक्चुएशंस होते रहेंगे ऊपर नीचे डिक्लाइन भी आएगा लेकिन अगर आपने एज एन आट गोल्ड खरीद के रखा हुआ है उसकी वैल्यू्यूएशन बढ़ती ही जाएगी जितनी पिछले साल से लेके अब तक गोल्ड में आपने राइस देखा है वह कुछ भी नहीं है आने वाले साल में गोल्ड गोल्ड अपनी और नई ऊंचाइयों को छुएगा। तो अगर अभी तक आपने गोल्ड को एज एन आट या एज अ सेविंग अभी तक नहीं किया है तो कर लीजिए क्योंकि गोल्ड अभी और आसमान छूने वाला है। सिल्वर के लिए भी मैं यही कह सकती हूं कि उसके लिए भी अच्छा टाइम है। सिल्वर भी काफी आगे भागेगा। लेकिन अगर एक इन्वेस्टमेंट की बात करें तो अगर दोनों में से आपको चूज़ करना है तो गोल्ड करें। क्योंकि सिल्वर का बेसिक जो डिपेंडेंसी है वह होती है इंडस्ट्रीज पे। ऑफ कोर्स इंडस्ट्रीज अच्छा परफॉर्म करने वाली हैं। कौन सी इंडस्ट्रीज होंगी वो वो भी मैं अभी डिस्कस करूंगी। लेकिन क्योंकि सिल्वर इंडस्ट्रीज पे डिपेंड करता है। अगर किसी एक पर्टिकुलर इंडस्ट्री में जो कि सिल्वर को को यूज़ करके अपनी चीजें बनाती है। उसमें डाउनफॉल आया या डिक्लाइन आया तो सिल्वर की कीमतें भी गिरेंगी। इसलिए एक पुख्ता एसेट के तौर पर अगर हम कहें तो गोल्ड सबसे सेफेस्ट और सबसे अच्छा इन्वेस्टमेंट हो सकता है। वह चाहे आप फिजिकल गोल्ड रखें या ईटीएफ ले लें। सूर्य सिर्फ गोल्ड को ही रिप्रेजेंट नहीं करता। कॉपर को भी करता है। इसलिए कॉपर भी एक बहुत अच्छा इन्वेस्टमेंट हो सकता है। आने वाले समय में कॉपर से रिलेटेड जो इंडस्ट्रीज हैं या जो इंडस्ट्रीज कॉपर को यूज़ करके चीजें बनाती हैं उनमें काफी हक आएगा। उसका कंजमशन ज्यादा होगा और कॉपर की वैल्यू बढ़ती हुई दिख रही है। तो कॉपर भी एक बहुत अच्छा इन्वेस्टमेंट साबित हो सकता है। अगर आप स्टॉक मार्केट या किसी ऑनलाइन इन्वेस्टमेंट करते हैं या उसके बारे में सोच रहे हैं। कॉपर इज गोइंग टू गो हाई। अब आ जाते हैं इंडस्ट्रीज पे कि कौन सी इंडस्ट्रीज 2026 में बेहतरीन करेंगी। स्टार्ट करते हैं एस्ट्रोलॉजिकल पर्सपेक्टिव से क्योंकि इस साल का राजा जुपिटर है जो कि एक स्पेस एलिमेंट है। तो स्पेस टेक्नोलॉजी काफी अच्छा करने वाली है। आप चाहे उस पर्टिकुलर स्पेस टेक्नोलॉजी इंडस्ट्री की बात करें या उस स्पेस टेक्नोलॉजी को इंप्लीमेंट करने के लिए जो चीजें इस्तेमाल होती हैं या जो कंपनीज या जो इंडस्ट्रीज उसको हेल्प करती हैं वह सभी चीजें स्काई रॉकेट होंगी। वह सभी चीजें बहुत अच्छा करेंगी। एग्जांपल के लिए स्पेस टेक्नोलॉजी बेसिकली टेक्नोलॉजी पर वर्क करती है। तो जो भी टेक्नोलॉजी से रिलेटेड असिस्टेंस दिया जाता है वो चाहे एआई हो, चिप हो, आपके सेमीकंडक्टर्स हो जो कंपनी इन चीजों पे वर्क कर रही है, उनके शेयर्स या उनकी इंडस्ट्री प्रेजेंस बहुत ज्यादा बढ़ने वाली है। क्योंकि जुपिटर अपना काम करेगा और स्पेस टेक्नोलॉजी में जो भी चीजें हो रही हैं वह आगे बढ़ती हुई दिख रही हैं। जुपिटर को एस्ट्रोलॉजी में जीव कारक भी कहा जाता है जो इंडिकेट करता है कि बायोटेक्नोलॉजी भी काफी अच्छा इस साल में करेगी। उससे रिलेटेड सेक्टर्स काफी अच्छा करेंगे। एक और वजह कि बायोटेक्नोलॉजी अच्छा करेगी क्योंकि न्यूमोलॉजिकली भी यह साल सन का है और सन को कहते हैं लाइफ गिवर। इस वजह से भी बायोटेक्नोलॉजी काफी अच्छा करती दिखाई दे रही है। और क्योंकि हम सूर्य की बात कर रहे हैं। सौर ऊर्जा यानी सोलर एनर्जी को हम पीछे नहीं छोड़ सकते। सोलर एनर्जी की इंडस्ट्रीज बहुत अच्छा करती हुई दिख रही हैं। अब क्योंकि सोलर एनर्जी से रिलेटेड फील्ड या सोलर एनर्जी से रिलेटेड कंपनीज़ को भी सिल्वर यूज करना पड़ता है या और ऐसी कंपनीज़ जो सिल्वर यूज़ करती हैं उनके भी स्टॉक प्रेजेंस, मार्केट प्रेजेंस या ग्रोथ बहुत अच्छी होती दिख रही है। और अब आते हैं साल के मंथली पे जो है मार्स अगेन। मार्स ने मार्स से रिलेटेड जितने भी प्रोडक्ट्स हैं, जितनी भी इंडस्ट्रीज हैं, उन्होंने पिछले साल 2025 में भी काफी अच्छा परफॉर्म किया। मार्स वेपंस और डिफेंस को भी इंडिकेट करता है जो फॉर सम रीज़न और दी अदर पिछले साल भारतपाकिस्तान वॉर हो या और जो दूसरी कंडीशंस बनी उसकी वजह से भी स्टॉक मार्केट में डिफेंस स्टॉक्स ने बहुत अच्छा परफॉर्म किया। इस साल अगेन क्योंकि मंथली हमारा मार्स है तो भी डिफेंस स्टॉक्स बढ़ते हुए ही दिख रहे हैं। सिर्फ डिफेंस स्टॉक्स नहीं मार्स मतलब एनर्जी। जितनी भी इंडस्ट्रीज एनर्जी से रिलेटेड हैं चाहे वो रिन्यूएबल एनर्जी हो, विंड एनर्जी हो या न्यूक्लियर एनर्जी हो। मार्स रिप्रेजेंट्स फायर। तो यह एनर्जी सेक्टर्स बूस्ट होते हुए दिख रहे हैं और यह आने वाले साल 2026 में बहुत अच्छा परफॉर्म करेंगे। एक एडवाइस जो लोग स्टॉक मार्केट में इन्वेस्ट करते हैं उनके लिए कभी भी ब्लाइंडली किसी भी चीज में इन्वेस्ट ना करें क्योंकि आपके पर्सनल चार्ट आपका पर्सनल नंबर बहुत मैटर करता है कि क्या आप स्टॉक मार्केट के लिए बने भी हुए हैं या नहीं बने हैं। क्योंकि इस साल की एनर्जी ऐसी है। वह एक जनरल प्रिकॉशन के तौर पे आप ले सकते हैं। सन लीडरशिप को डिनोट करता है और सन वाइज डिसीजन को भी डिनोट करता है। सन स्टेबिलिटी को भी डिनोट करता है। इसीलिए इस साल शॉर्ट टर्म गेंस ना करें। उसके लिए चाह भी ना रखें। अगर आप स्टॉक मार्केट में इन्वेस्ट भी करते हैं तो लॉन्ग टर्म गोल्स पे जाएं। यह सेफ ऑप्शन भी रहेगा और आपकी जो ईयर की एनर्जी है उससे भी चैनलाइज होगा। सिर्फ इतना ही नहीं अगर आपको लगता है कि आप थोड़े से स्केप्टिक हैं कि आपको स्टॉक मार्केट में इन्वेस्ट करना भी है या नहीं तो उसके लिए आप अपने चार्ट का एनालिसिस जरूर करवाएं कि क्या आप का चार्ट आपको अलऊ करता है कि आप स्टॉक मार्केट में इन्वेस्ट करें या आपको किस तरह के इन्वेस्टमेंट करने चाहिए। यह एनालाइज करने के बाद ही स्टॉक मार्केट में इन्वेस्ट करें। क्योंकि जनरल गाइडलाइंस पे आप ब्लाइंडली डिनोट ब्लाइंडली भरोसा नहीं कर सकते हैं कि क्या आपके लिए भी अच्छा होगा या नहीं। यही रीजन है कि सेम स्टॉक्स में या सेम फील्ड में दो अलग-अलग लोग जब इन्वेस्ट करते हैं तो एक को फायदा होता है और एक को नुकसान। एक स्टेबल रहता है कि मुझे इसे लेके छोड़ देना है और दूसरा कहता है कि नहीं मुझे क्विक बेनिफिट चाहिए और वह विड्रॉ कर लेता है। यही रीज़ंस हैं कि एक ही स्टॉक में दो अलग-अलग लोगों को अलग-अलग डिसीजन मेकिंग की वजह से नुकसान होता है। सो ओवरऑल यह पूरा साल सन की एनर्जी पे बेस्ड रहेगा। मार्स की एनर्जी पे बेस्ड रहेगा और सन और मार्स से रिलेटेड जो आप डिसीजंस लेते हैं वो तभी आपके लिए फ्रूटफुल होंगे जब आप जुपिटर की प्रिंसिपल और गाइडलाइंस को फॉलो कर रहे हैं। इन जनरल अगर मैं यह कहूं कि क्योंकि यह साल सन का है तो आपको सन की तरह डिसिप्लिन रहना है या फिट रहने के लिए एक्सरसाइज करनी है तो यह एक पर्टिकुलर ईयर के लिए मेरी आपको एडवाइस नहीं रहेगी। फिट रहने के लिए, डिसिप्लिन रहने के लिए आपको लाइफ के हर साल में अपने आप से प्रॉमिस करना होता है कि हमें डिसिप्लिन रहना है, हमें फिट रहना है। क्योंकि साल चाहे कोई भी हो, अगर आप डिसिप्लिंड नहीं है, अगर आप फिट नहीं है, अगर आप हेल्दी नहीं हैं तो आपकी लाइफ की बाकी सारी चीजें उस तरह से नहीं होंगी जैसे आप चाहते हैं। वर्ल्ड और इंडिया के लिए न्यूमरोलॉजी और एस्ट्रोलॉजी के पर्सपेक्टिव से ये कुछ प्रेडिक्शंस थी। बाकी इंडिविजुअली हर एक साइन के लिए हर एक नंबर के लिए एक अलग वीडियो आएगा। होप वो आपके लिए थोड़ा सा बेनिफिशियल हो। नमस्कार।",

बाजार के हिसाब से अगर बात कर लें ब्रॉड लेवल पे इंडाइससेस लेवल पे। ठीक है? मतलब निफ्ट्टी 50 की अगर बात कर लें तो इतना कुछ खास दमदार नहीं रहा। फिर भी हम बोल सकते हैं जाते-जाते तो चलो 26,000 के ऊपर फिलहाल तो चल रहे हैं। ठीक है? अभी वीडियो बना रहा हूं उस हिसाब से बात करें। अभी भी तीन ट्रेडिंग सेशन यहां पे बाकी है। बट फिर भी अगर आप देखोगे साल भर के हिसाब से 10% का रिटर्न तो नजर यहां पे आ रहा है। ठीक है? वह भी आखिरी समय पे जाके जब 26,000 का यहां पे शकल देखने को मिल रहा है। तभी वरना यह रिटर्न्स तो मतलब लिटरली ना के बराबर थे। ठीक है? मतलब हम कह सकते हैं कि ओवरऑल यह जो साल रहा है 2025 इन्वेस्टर के लिए मतलब इतना कुछ खास नहीं रहा है। ठीक है? एंड नो डाउट इसमें अब जब कोई भी नया साल आता है तो सबसे ज्यादा पॉपुलर सवाल यही रहता है सर व्हाट अबाउट 2026 2026 में क्या होगा वो बता दीजिए क्योंकि एज अ इन्वेस्टर अगर देखा गया 2025 तो लिटरली काफी बोरिंग यहां पे था तो क्या 2026 भी वैसा ही रहेगा एंड देखिए जैसे मैंने वीडियो की शुरुआत में ही आपको क्या बोला कि मतलब बोलते हैं ना सच बोलूं कि अच्छा बोलूं वैसी चीज है हर किसी का पैसा मार्केट में लगा है एज अ इन्वेस्टर अगर हम बात करें तो लंबी अवधि के लिए और हर कोई क्या होता है ना दोस्तों मतलब अच्छा सुनना ही पसंद करता है कि हां भाई बोल दो एकदम धमाकेदार भाई पोर्टफोलियो 10-10 गुना यहां पे हो जाएगा हर किसी की लाइफ बदल जाएगी ये चीजें मैं बोल सकता हूं ठीक है बट जेनुइनली अगर मैं आपके सामने चीजें रख दूं तो अगर इस चैनल को जो फॉलो करते हैं उनको पता है कि एग्जैक्टली अगर आप यह पूछोगे कि अगले साल 2026 में यहां पे क्या होने वाला है तो इस सवाल का एक्चुअल जवाब यहां पे रहेगा दोस्तों जो कड़वी सच्चाई यही है यस आई डोंट नो मतलब यह किसी को पता नहीं होता है दोस्तों यह मैंने काफी बार आप लोगों को ये चीज बताई है। लोगों को कैसा थोड़ा सा अच्छा सुनना है मतलब मजा आता है ना आपने देखा भी होगा ऐसे बहुत सारे वीडियोस 2026 में क्या होगा बाजार में इसको लेकर बहुत सारी चीजें आपको देखने को मिलेगी बट हकीकत किसी को पता नहीं होती है क्यों ऐसा क्यों क्योंकि जैसे मैंने आप लोगों को बताया कि फ्यूचर भाई किसी को नहीं पता है फ्यूचर मतलब क्या देखिए बाजार ऊपर जाएगा नीचे जाएगा ये कैसा रहता है कि एक इवेंट्स के ऊपर भी डिपेंड करता है आप मुझे बता दो कौन-कौन से इवेंट्स भविष्य में होने वाले हैं क्या आपको पता है कि 2026 में कोई वॉर होगी 2025 में सडनली हम लोगों ने देखा इंडिया पाकिस्तान कितना बड़ा कॉन्फ्लिक्ट क्या हमें यह पता था 2025 मतलब 24 के एंड में कि 25 आ रहा है तो ऐसा कुछ वॉर देखने को मिलेगा? वॉर मतलब हम कह सकते हैं जो भी चीजें हुई थी ऑपरेशन सिंदूर एंड ऑल दैट इतना टेंस माहौल। ठीक है? किसी को नहीं पता था। 2019 के अंत में किसी को पता था कि 2020 में एंटर कर रहे हैं। 2 महीने के बाद भाई घर पे बैठना पड़ने वाला है। लॉकडाउन लगने वाला है मार्च में। किसी को नहीं पता था। ठीक है? सो इस प्रकार के मतलब क्या है दोस्तों? ये जो फ्यूचर होता है, यह अनप्रेडिक्टबल होता है। किसी को नहीं पता होता है। ठीक है? सो अगेन यहां पर कह रहा हूं कि आप अगर अपनी एनर्जी यहां पर वेस्ट करोगे कि एग्जैक्टली आगे क्या यहां पे होने वाला है। सो आप लिटरली यहां पे टाइम वेस्ट यहां पे कर रहे हो और एक मजेदार बात ले लो। अब क्या चल रहा है? कॉपर सिल्वर गोल्ड चल रहा है कि नहीं? एकदम धमाकेदार। किसी ने इस चीज की बात यहां पे की थी कि कॉपर गोल्ड सिल्वर एकदम धुआंधार तेजी आएगी। किसी ने भी नहीं। क्यों? क्योंकि जैसे मैंने बोला ना फ्यूचर अनप्रिडिक्टेबल होता है दोस्तों। ठीक है? आप एग्जैक्टली इन चीजों को एकदम परफेक्टली यहां पे लेकर नहीं जाओगे। ठीक है? आप 10 चीजें बोल सकते हो। उसमें से एक वो लग जाता है। सो अगेन यही पॉइंट मैं आप लोगों को कहने की कोशिश कर रहा हूं। हां तो कुछ लोग ये बोल सकते हैं कि सर अगर कुछ भी नहीं पता है तो ये तो अंधेरे में तीर चलाने जैसी चीज हो गई कि ये तो मतलब तुक्के के हिसाब से हो गई। नहीं ऐसा बिल्कुल भी नहीं है। मैं इसके पहले भी आपको बोल चुका हूं कि लॉजिक को समझो। एक चीज को हमेशा याद रखना गोल्डन रूल को याद रखना कि आप जो ये चीज देख रहे हो ना अभी जैसे कि 2025 की बात कर लें। ठीक है? बड़े लेवल पे बाजार में कुछ इतना खास परफॉर्मेंस देखने को नहीं मिला। बट क्या पैसा नहीं बना? ऐसा बिल्कुल भी नहीं भाई। काफी सारे सेक्टर्स ने काफी जबरदस्त परफॉर्मेंस दिया है। उस सेक्टर से जुड़े हुए काफी सारे इंडिविजुअल स्टॉक्स ने कंपनीज़ ने काफी बढ़िया रिटर्न दिया है। ठीक है? काफी सारे इंडिविजुअल स्टॉक्स हम लोग को भागते हुए देखने को यहां पे मिले हैं। सेक्टर अच्छा भागते हुए देखने को मिला है। सो ऐसा ही होता है दोस्तों बाजार में। याद रखना बाजार में मतलब ऐसा नहीं कि हर जगह पे अगर आप देखोगे कि बस तेजी तेजी तेजी ऐसा ही मतलब बस बाजार भाग ही रहा है। ठीक है? जिस दिन आपको इस प्रकार की चीजें नजारे देखने को मिलेंगे ना कि बाजार बस भाग ही रहा है। किधर भी गिरावट नहीं है। यस उसको बुल रन बोलते हैं। और इस प्रकार के रन काफी रेयरली हम लोगों को देखने को मिल जाते हैं। ठीक है? वो कब आएगा भविष्य में बुल रन भाई वो किसी को पता नहीं होता है। जिसको पता होगा भाई मुझे बता देना। मैं उसके पहले ही पैसे लगा दूंगा। ठीक है? बट यस तभी जाके वो पैसा एकदम बोलते हैं ना पागलों की तरह यहां पे बनता है। वरना अगर बाजार देखा गया ना दोस्तों आपने 2025 में जो चीजें देखी है वैसे ही रहता है कि ओवरऑल ब्रॉड लेवल पे आपको स्लो परफॉर्मेंस ही देखने को मिलेगा एंड इंडिविजुअल बेसिस के ऊपर आपको अच्छा परफॉर्मेंस देखने को यहां पे मिलेगा। ठीक है? सो ये गोल्डन रूल हमेशा याद रखना कि आपने जो ये 25 में मार्केट देखा है ना मार्केट यूजुअली उसी प्रकार से यहां पे चलता है। आपका स्टॉक सिलेक्शन सेक्टर सिलेक्शन यह अच्छा होना चाहिए। ठीक है? और हर सेक्टर ऐसा कभी नहीं होगा कि सारे सेक्टर ऊपर भाग रहे हैं। मैंने अभी बताया ना कि ऐसा होगा तो वही वो बुल रन रहता है। यह रोटेशन हमेशा हम लोगों को चलते हुए देखने को यहां पे मिलते रहते हैं। सो अच्छे सेक्टर को आइडेंटिफाई यहां पे करना माहौल को समझना। मैं कहता हूं ना कि कंपनी को समझो। बिजनेस की अंडरस्टैंडिंग लो। ये मैं बार-बार चिल्ला-चिल्ला कर आपको क्यों बताता हूं? क्योंकि जिसको बिज़नेस की अंडरस्टैंडिंग आई वो मार्केट में मतलब बोलते हैं ना खराब माहौल में भी पैसे बना लेता है। और इसका अगर मैं आपको एक बेस्ट एग्जांपल यहां पे दे दूं तो कौन सा एग्जांपल रहेगा? कोविड का एग्जांपल पकड़ लो। अब कोविड में तो मार्केट क्रैश हुआ था। हालत खराब हुई थी। बट फिर भी वहां पर भी उस आपदा में भी कुछ सेक्टर के लिए बिजनेसेस के लिए अवसर क्रिएट हुआ था। कौन सा? फार्मा सेक्टर। एंड फार्मा सेक्टर में भी जब कोविड हम लोगों ने देखा था। एक नॉर्मल थिंकिंग क्या थी लोगों की कि कौन सा बिजनेस अच्छा करेगा? मास्क वाला बिज़नेस अच्छा करेगा। इट इज़ ट्रू। ठीक है? देन उसके बाद लगा था कि यह जो वैक्सीन वाली कंपनियां है, कोवि शील्ड की बात कर ले, कोवैक्सीन की बात कर ले। ठीक है? यह कंपनियां अच्छा यहां पे कर सकती है। पर सबसे ज्यादा एक्चुअल में पैसा किसने कमाया था? उस वक्त तो मैंने वीडियो बनाकर भी आपको बताया था कि यह चीजें गलत नहीं है। ठीक है? बट लोगों का ध्यान कहां पर नहीं है? जो बिजनेस सबसे ज्यादा कमाई करेगा वो बिजनेस कौन सा था? यस कोविड-19 से रिलेटेड जो टेस्टिंग आरटीपीसीआर जो टेस्टिंग था वो बिजनेस सबसे ज्यादा चलेगा। क्यों? क्योंकि अगर वैक्सीन की बात कर रहे ठीक है भाई। आप देखा गया तो डो दो दो डोज़ थे वैक्सीन के। उसके बाद तो कुछ था नहीं। एंड सरकार उन कंपनीज़ को पे करेगी। एंड अगर देखा गया तो कोविड शील्ड से रिलेटेड ही एस्ट्राजेनाका की अगर बात कर लें उससे रिलेटेड हम लोगों को कुछ बाजार में प्रेजेंस देखने को मिलता था। वो जो दूसरी वैक्सीन थी वो तो हम लोगों को देखने को भी नहीं मिलती थी। सो जो ये आरटीपीसीआर वाली कंपनियां थी हां ये तो मार्केट में भी यहां पे थी। आप सभी लोगों को यहां पे पता ही होगा। कौन सी? डॉ. लाल पाथ लैब, मेट्रोपॉलिस हेल्थ केयर। ठीक है? इन कंपनीज़ ने यहां पे क्या किया था? जबरदस्त पैसा यहां पे छापा था। आप इनके चार्ट देख सकते हो। थायरो ने इतना क्यों नहीं कमाया कोविड के वक्त? क्योंकि उनका एंटीजन टेस्ट था। एंटीजन मतलब वो सिर्फ देखा गया तो आई गेस एक ही जगह से सैंपल लेते थे। आइदर नाक से या फिर मुंह से ही सैंपल लेते थे। आरटीपीसीआर में कैसे रहता था? दोनों जगह से सैंपल नाक से भी मुंह से भी। एंड इसीलिए बहुत सारे अगर आप रेलवे एयरपोर्ट किधर भी अगर आप जाओगे तो यह सर्टिफिकेट होना लेटेस्ट टू लेटेस्ट वाला यह काफी इंपॉर्टेंट था। और जैसे आपको बताया कि वैक्सीन तो दो बार ही लगती थी। उसके बाद तो नहीं। बट आरटीपीसीआर टेस्टिंग की बात करें तो लोगों को चार-चार पांच-प 10-10 बार भी करना पड़ता था अगर उनको यहां से वहां जाना होता था तो। ठीक है? मतलब क्या है दोस्तों कि ऐसे सिचुएशन में भी यहां पे इस प्रकार की कंपनीज़ ने बहुत अच्छा पैसा कमाया। ठीक है? ये ये चीज मतलब क्या है दोस्तों? ये चीज आपको दर्शाती है कि बाजार में हमेशा अपॉर्चुनिटीज रहती है। ठीक है? आपका ऑब्जरवेशन स्किल, आपकी बिजनेस की अंडरस्टैंडिंग। ठीक है? वो आपको पैसा कमा कर देगी। ठीक है? अब जो सिर्फ प्राइस को देखते हैं। ठीक है? उनके लिए तो भाई यह वीडियो ही बोरिंग रहेगा। वो तो बोलेंगे भाई कुछ तो शेयर के नाम बता दो। ठीक है? उसमें अंधा पैसा झोंक देंगे। ठीक है? सट्टा खेलेंगे। ये इस प्रकार से अगर आप सोचोगे तो फिर काफी मुश्किल हो जाएगी। सो लर्निंग पॉइंट क्या है दोस्तों? अभी तक मैंने जो आप लोगों को बताया है यस कि हमेशा बाजार में क्या रहती है? 24/7 ठीक है? 365 डेज मार्केट में अपॉर्चुनिटी हमेशा रहती है। हां ये बात सच है। कड़वी सच है कि इस प्रकार से जब बाजार का माहौल होता है उसमें इस प्रकार की अपॉर्चुनिटी को गैब करना काफी मुश्किल हो जाता है। ठीक है? बुल रन में तो भाई किधर भी चले जाओ पेनी स्टॉक में पैसा 5-प 10-10 गुना होता है। बट वहां पे एग्जिट सही होना चाहिए। वरना आपको पता ही है पेनी स्टॉक बिना फंडामेंटल्स के तेजी तो आ जाती है बट यस खत्म भी हो जाते हैं। सो जिन्होंने प्रॉपर्ली एग्जिट लिया पेनी स्टॉक में भाई वो उनका पैसा बच जाता बन जाता है। बाकी लोग तो भाई बुरी तरीके से फंस जाते हैं। वो कोविड में जो भागे हुए थे ना पेनी स्टॉक उसके बाद जो बुल रन आया था रेड कट हर जगह पे हम लोग को देखने को मिला था। आज तक वो रिकवर नहीं हुए हैं और होंगे भी नहीं क्योंकि फंडामेंटल्स ही नहीं है। क्यों आएंगे रिकवरी करने के लिए तो लोग उसमें ट्रैप हो गए। मतलब पॉइंट क्या है दोस्तों कि पैसा हर वक्त यहां पे बाजार में यहां पे बनता है। हां ऐसे माहौल में थोड़ा पैसा निकालना मुश्किल हो जाता है। ठीक है? तो ये चीज हम लोगों ने यहां पे समझनी है। मतलब क्या है दोस्तों कि अगर आप यहां पे 2025 को ही एनालिसिस यहां पे करोगे। सो बाजार के लिए टफ टाइम था बट कुछ सेक्टर में काफी अच्छा किया। जैसे कि अगर गोल्ड की बात कर लें। गोल्ड ने अच्छा किया तो गोल्ड लोन वाली कंपनी ने देख लो। काफी अच्छे रिटर्न्स जनरेट करके दिए। लोगों का पैसा डबल डबल होते हुए देखने को मिल गया। मतलब अपॉर्चुनिटी तो थी। अब जिसको वो चीजें दिखी उसका पैसा बना। ठीक है? देन अगर हम लोग यहां पर बात कर लें सडनली हम सभी लोगों ने यहां पर देख लिया रेयर अर्थ को लेकर एकदम से ही चीजें बदलते हुए देखने को मिल गई। वहां से सरकार से अनाउंसमेंट आते हुए देखने को मिल गई। तो उससे रिलेटेड काम करने वाली कंपनियां अच्छा खासा परफॉर्मेंस देने लगी। फाइनेंस सेगमेंट तो एवरग्रीन सेगमेंट रहता है। बट इसका अर्थ इन्हें ये नहीं कि भाई हर कोई भागेगा। बट बहुत सारे जो डिसेंट फाइनेंस वाली कंपनियां हैं उन्होंने भी काफी अच्छा परफॉर्मेंस यहां पे दिया है। ठीक है? आईपीओ में भी हम लोगों ने देखा काफी सारे आईपीओ आए थे लिस्टिंग गेन से रिलेटेड जहां पे अच्छे-अच्छे अगर आप एनालिसिस करके अगर आप जाओगे तो वहां पे भी अच्छा खासा पैसा बनते हुए देखने को यहां पे मिला था। ठीक है? अभी सिल्वर अच्छा कर रहा है तो सिल्वर लिंक कंपनी यहां पे देख सकते हैं। वहां पे पैसा बनते हुए देखने को मिल रहा है। मतलब क्या है दोस्तों? अपॉर्चुनिटीज़ तो रहती है। ठीक है? और कोई भी आपको पहले आके यह बात बताएगा नहीं। ठीक है? कि एग्जैक्टली मतलब यह तो ऐसा हो गया कि आप बैटिंग करने जा रहे हो और आप कह रहे हो बॉलर को भाई तो पहले बता दो कि मुझे यॉर्कर डालेगा, स्लोअर डिलीवरी डालेगा, कटर डालेगा या बाउंसर डालेगा। इतना अगर सिंपल है तो भाई हो गया क्रिकेट भी कितना सिंपल हो गया। अच्छा बाउंसर आने वाला है। मैं रेडी रहता हूं। सो कोई भी चीज आपको पहले एडवांस में बताकर आने वाली नहीं है। 2026 में एग्जैक्टली क्या होने वाला है। ठीक है? बट यस जैसे मैंने अभी आप लोगों को क्या बताया कि अपॉर्चुनिटी हमेशा हम लोगों को देखने को यहां पे मिल जाती है। तो वैसे ही 2026 में भी जैसे-जैसे सिचुएशन रहेगा उस हिसाब से अपॉर्चुनिटीज़ यहां पे बनती रहेगी। ठीक है? अभी के करंट सिनेरियो के हिसाब से अगर देखा गया ठीक है? तो आप यहां पे देख सकते हो जैसे अभी बताया रेयर अर्थ का जोेंस है ये कोई एक दिन एक साल के लिए नहीं है। यह सालों साल चलने वाला है। तो इससे रिलेटेड कंपनीज़ के लिए काफी स्कोप अच्छा खासा बन रहा है। ठीक है? सरकार भी इसको सपोर्ट अभी करते हुए देखने को यहां पे मिल रहा है। देन पोलशन इतना बढ़ रहा है तो पोलशन से रिलेटेड जो काम करने वाली कंपनीज़ हैं उनको जबरदस्त अपॉर्चुनिटीज़ यहां पे क्रिएट होने वाली है। ठीक है? क्योंकि ये ऐसा नहीं है कि अभी का प्रॉब्लम है। ये तो बहुत सालों साल चलने वाला प्रॉब्लम है। जिसको जो कंपनी सॉल्व यहां पे करेगी चाहे छोटे लेवल पे क्यों ना करें। सो वहां पे पैसे बनने के यहां पे चांसेस रहेंगे। देन कमोडिटीज में जैसे अभी हम लोगों ने देख लिया जो अच्छा कर रहा है उससे रिलेटेड काम करने वाली जो बिजनेस करने वाली कंपनी है वहां पे उनका रेवेन्यू प्रॉफिट बढ़ने के चांसेस यहां पे रहेंगे। सो इस प्रकार से दोस्तों ये चक्र बदलता रहता है। ठीक है? अब कोविड से रिलेटेड मौका आया था वो मौका चला गया उसके बाद वो कंपनियां नीचे आ गई। ठीक है? पैसे यहां पे बन गए। तो वो मतलब बोलते हैं ना आपका सही टाइमिंग भी लगना वहां पे आपको आना चाहिए। ठीक है? ऐसा बिल्कुल भी नहीं रहेगा कि एवर ग्रेनिंग बस हमेशा यहां पे चीजें यहां पे चलती रहेगी। चलती रहेगी, चलती रहेगी, चलती रहेगी। नहीं। ठीक है? स्टॉक मार्केट है भाई चीजें ऊपर नीचे ऊपर नीचे ऊपर नीचे यहां पे होती रहती है। सो अगेन कह रहा है दोस्तों कंक्लूजन के फॉर्म में कि सेगमेंट वाइज सेक्टर वाइज बिजनेस वाइज कंपनी वाइज आपका ज्यादा फोकस यहां पे होना चाहिए। ब्रॉड लेवल पे अगर आप चीजों को देखने जाओगे तो वहां पे तो अनसर्टेनिटी हमेशा देखने को मिलेगी। ट्रंप कुछ बोल देगा ट्रेड डील हो जाएगी फिर नहीं हो जाएगी फिर विड्रॉ हो जाएगी कुछ करेंगे। ये चीजें चलती रहती है। ठीक है? बट यस इंडिविजुअल वाइज अगर आप चीजों को स्टडी करने जाओगे तो यस आपको अपॉर्चुनिटी हमेशा बाजार में देखने को यहां पे मिलेगी और इसी के ऊपर आपका अच्छा कमांड यहां पे आना चाहिए क्योंकि इसी में ही मतलब बोलते हैं ना इसी को ही मार्केट बोलते हैं। सब कुछ एक साथ भागेगा। यह काफी रेयरली हम लोगों को देखने को यहां पे मिल जाता है। सो ठीक है दोस्तों। आई होप आपको यह प्रैक्टिकल वीडियो अच्छा यहां पे लगा होगा। आप चाहो तो इसको लाइक एंड शेयर कर सकते हो। एंड जाते-जाते आप इस चैनल को भी विजिट यहां पे कर सकते हो। जो वीडियो यहां पे मैंने कवर किया है, यह काफी काम का वीडियो हो सकता है 2026 में। लिटरली अगर आप पैसा कमाना चाहते हो दोस्तों, तो यह वाला वीडियो देख लेना। काफी यूज़फुल यहां पर हो सकता है। स्क्रीन के ऊपर भी शायद से आपको यह देखने को मिला होगा। आप इसके ऊपर क्लिक करके आप वहां पर डायरेक्टली जंप कर सकते हो। चलिए दोस्तों, मिलते हैं अगले वीडियो में। तब तक के लिए बाय-ब।",
  "ZotC3kaeIEY": "क्या आपको याद है 2024 का वो जो डर का माहौल बना हुआ था इलेक्शंस का शोर था ग्लोबल रिसेशन की बातें हो रही थी और वो सवाल कि क्या इंडिया का बुल रन अप खत्म हो जाएगा इस तरह के सब लोग चर्चा कर रहे थे वेल आज के दिन जब मैं ये वीडियो रिकॉर्ड कर रहा हूं दिसंबर 2025 अंत के दिनों में हम वहीं पर खड़े हैं और अगर मैं सिर्फ एक वर्ड में इस साल को समराइज करने की कोशिश करूं तो वो वर्ड होगा डीकपलिंग पहले क्या होता था। अमेरिका को थोड़ी सी भी छींक आती थी तो इंडिया को बीमारी लग जाती थी। इंडिया में वायरस आ जाता था। वॉल स्ट्रीट गिरता था वहां पर यूएस में तो दलाल स्ट्रीट कहीं ना कहीं कांपने लग जाता था कि थर थर थरथर क्या हो रहा था। पर 2025 में ये सारी पुरानी किताबें ही फाड़ दी है। पुराने लॉजिक्स ही फाड़ दिए। इस साल इंडिया ने दुनिया को दिखा दिया कि हम किसी के सहारे नहीं बैठे। हमें अपनी इनफ्लेशन खुद संभाली है। अपना मार्केट खुद चलाया है। और अपना नया अमृतकाल जो कहते हैं वो खुद लिखा है। आज की इस वीडियो में मैं आपको कोई नॉर्मल रिककैप नहीं देने वाला हूं। मैं पूरी तरीके से आपको बताऊंगा कि 2026 में इन्वेस्टर्स किस प्रकार से करोड़पति बने। हम बात करेंगे उन चार मेजर सेगमेंट्स की जिस हिसाब से मैं इक्विटीज की। मैं बात कर रहा हूं बिटकॉइन यानी क्रिप्टो करेंसीज की। मैं बात कर रहा हूं सिल्वर के पागलपन की और साथ में रियलस्टेट के नए ट्रेंड्स की। तो आप जहां पर भी बैठे हैं दिल थाम के बैठिए। चाय पीते-पीते या पकोड़े खा रहे हैं तो पकोड़े खाते-खाते इस वीडियो को एंजॉय कीजिए और कुछ भी पसंद आए तो लाइक जरूर कीजिएगा क्योंकि मैं आपको आज बताऊंगा द ग्रेट इंडियन पिवट की पूरी कहानी जो 2025 में लिखी गई। सबसे पहले हम बात करेंगे इक्विटीज की। देखिए हमारे वेल्थ का सबसे बड़ा इंजन जो हम स्टार्टिंग से अपने चैनल पर बोलते आए हैं वो है स्टॉक मार्केट। 2025 की शुरुआत काफी ज्यादा ठंडी थी। लेट्स फेस इट। मार्केट काफी ज्यादा साइडवेज जा रहा था। अगर आप लोगों को ध्यान होगा लोग कह रहे थे कि यार वैल्यू्यूएशंस बहुत ज्यादा महंगी है और निफ्टी 24,000 से लेके 25,000 के बीच में कहीं ना कहीं फंस गया था। पर फिर आ गया था द ग्रेट पिव्ट। कहां से पिव्ट आया? क्यों? मार्केट अचानक से थोड़ा सा रोमांच में आया। अगर आपको याद होगा 2024 अक्टूबर में एक पडकास्ट मैंने कहा था कि 2025 में एक भारी गिरावट आई थी। स्टार्टिंग में ही 15% की गिरावट आई थी। लेकिन द आरबीआई मैजिक हुआ। जब पूरी दुनिया के सेंट्रल बैंक्स डर के मारे इंटरेस्ट रेट्स हाई रख रहे थे तब हमारे आरबीआई गवर्नर ने दिसंबर में एक गुगली डाली। 25 बेसिस पॉइंट्स का रेट कट। रेपो रेट अब 5.25% पर है। इसका मतलब समझते हो? जब इंटरेस्ट रेट गिरता है तो दो चीजें होती है। क्या होती है? पहला कंपनीज़ के लिए लोन सस्ता हो जाता है। यानी उनका प्रॉफ़िट बढ़ जाता है क्योंकि वह ज्यादा लोन लेके ज्यादा काम कर पाते हैं। दूसरा इन्वेस्टर्स को एफडी में कम इंटरेस्ट रेट मिलता है। इसलिए वो अपना पैसा कहीं और लगाते हैं। दैट इज स्टॉक मार्केट। तो वो एफडी से तोड़ के स्टॉक मार्केट में लगाते हैं। उसके बाद एक डीआईआई की बहुत बड़ी दीवार बनी इस साल। इस साल का असली हीरो एफआईआई मतलब फॉरेन इंस्टीट्यूशनल इन्वेस्टर नहीं बल्कि डीआईआई डोमेस्टिक इंस्टीट्यूशनल इन्वेस्टर्स रहे हैं। लास्ट 12 महीनों में डीआईआई ने लगभग 7 लाख करोड़ 7 लाख करोड़ की इक्विटीज खरीदी। पता है ये पैसा कहां से आया होगा? सोचिए कहां से आया होगा? ये आया है आपके और मेरे एसआईपी से। मंथली एसआईपी फ्लो 25,000 करोड़ क्रॉस कर चुका है। ये एक ऐसी दीवार बन चुका है कि ग्लोबल शॉक्स भी हमारे मार्केट को इस साल हिला नहीं पाए। इसके अलावा सेक्टरल रोटेशन को हम समझते हैं कि कहां सबसे ज्यादा पैसा बना है। 2025 में अंधाधुंध पैसा बना है कुछ-कुछ जगह पर। इस साल स्मार्ट मनी ने सेक्टर चूज़ किया। सबसे पहले हम बात करेंगे बैंकिंग और फाइनेंसियल की। रेट कट की वजह से इनका क्रेडिट ग्रोथ बढ़ गया है। बैंक्स अब सिर्फ डिपॉजिट नहीं ले रहे हैं। वो कहीं ना कहीं ढल रहे हैं और कहीं ना कहीं लोनस बहुत सारे लोगों में बांट रहे हैं। जब ज्यादा लोंस बांटते हैं तो उनको बदले में ईएमआई के रूप में बहुत ज्यादा पैसा मिल रहा है। रूरल में भी कहीं ना कहीं रिवाइवल देखा गया है। दो साल से गांव की इकॉनमी ठंडी थी। पर 2025 में एक अच्छे मसून और गवर्नमेंट स्पेंडिंग के कारण मैजिक ही हो गया। यहां पर एफएमसीजी स्टॉक्स जैसे कि HL, ITC और एंट्री लेवल ऑटो स्टॉक्स जैसे कि Hero Motcop हो गया, Maruti हो गया। इन सब ने एक बहुत जबरदस्त कमबैक दिया। आईटी की बात करूं तो एक सेक्टर जो पीछे रह गया था वो था आईटी। यूएस और यूरोप में अभी भी रिसेशन फियर की वजह से कंपनीज़ से स्पेंडिंग कम रखी थी। इसलिए आईटी सेक्टर ने इस साल थोड़ा बहुत रुलाया है। अब 2026 के लिए क्या वर्डिक्ट आ रहा है? के एक्सपर्ट्स जितने बड़े-बड़े ब्रोकर्स हो गए, बड़े-बड़े फंड मैनेजर्स हो गए, उनकी माने तो निफ्टी 29,000 की तरफ बढ़ रहा है। अर्निंग्स अपग्रेड साइकिल शुरू हो चुका है और अगर आपने डिप्स पर खरीदा है तो आप ऑलरेडी एक विनर हो। ये मान के चलो। अब हम समझते हैं दूसरे एस्पेक्ट को जो कि है क्रिप्टो। पहले मैं इसको और डिटेल में समझाने के लिए पहले हाल फिलहाल में मेरा बिटकॉइन को लेके क्या है वो बताने के लिए आपको स्क्रीन पे लेके चलता हूं। तो चलिए पहले चलते हैं स्क्रीन पे। स्क्रीन पर आ चुके हैं और आपको स्क्रीन पर दिख रहा होगा डेल्टा एक्सचेंज का इंटरफेस। हाल फिलहाल पर जब इस वीडियो को रिकॉर्ड किया जा रहा है तो एक छोटे 10 मिनट के चार्ट फ्रेम पे दिख रहा है। किस प्रकार से बिटकॉइन ने अचानक से एक 8685000 के लेवल से 8957 पे छलांग मारी। अगर आप लोग हमारे वीडियोस को रेगुलरली देखते हैं तो आपको ये चीज क्लियरली पता होगी कि हम ये बहुत बार बोल चुके हैं कि ये अगर 85000 86000 ये एक ऐसा सपोर्ट लेवल है जहां से कि हमको एक बाउंस दिखेगा। लेकिन ऊपर की तरफ 90,000 के आसपास एक रेजिस्टेंस है। जब इस चार्ट को हम थोड़ा सा बड़ा करते हैं तो हमको ये एक चीज क्लियर दिखती है कि ऊपरली लेवल्स पे ऑलमोस्ट 90900 के आसपास एक अच्छा रेजिस्टेंस अभी भी बना पड़ा हुआ है। अगर हम केवल आवरली चार्ट्स के हिसाब से भी देखते हैं। और अगर हम इन चार्ट्स को और थोड़ा एक्सपैंड करने की कोशिश करते हैं मेरे दोस्तों तो हमें क्या दिखता है? हमें ये दिखता है कि अगर हम फोर आवर चार्ट के हिसाब से देखते हैं तो फोर आवर चार्ट पे भी 90000 हमारा पहला लेवल है। क्योंकि देखिए हर्डल्स कितने ज्यादा है। हमने इसको दिसंबर 12 से लेके अ दिसंबर 14 तक भी रेजिस्ट किया है। उसके बाद यहां पर भी जो एक विक बना ये देखिए ये ऑलमोस्ट इसका अगर आप हाई देखते हैं इस वीक का 9373 मतलब 17 दिसंबर को भी हमने इस एरिया को रेजिस्ट किया हुआ है। इसके बाद इस वाले कैंडल को भी देखेंगे 22 दिसंबर को तो करीब 994 यहां पर भी रेजिस्ट किया है और यहां पर भी अगर आप देखेंगे ऑलमोस्ट 22 दिसंबर को हमने वापस 9585 तो एक चीज क्लियर दिखा रही है पूरे दिसंबर मंथ में जब से हमारा ये ब्रेकडाउन कैंडल आया है हमने 90000 को कहीं ना कहीं रेजिस्ट किया है तो अभी हाल फिलहाल पे जब ये वीडियो रिकॉर्ड किया जा रहा है 88000 का ये लेवल है जब तक 90000 का लेवल नहीं टूटता है तब तक यहां पर एक रिस्क कायम रहेगा। तो सबसे पहली चीज होगी बिटकॉइन को 90,000 का लेवल। तो अभी हाल फिलहाल में बहुत बड़ा कोई मेरे को एक्शन बिटकॉइन पे दिख नहीं रहा। स्कैल्पर्स को जरूर अपॉर्चुनिटीज मिलेगी। जब भी 88 89,000 के आसपास आता है एक 5000 पॉइंट के ऊपर का रिस्क लेके नीचे 2000 2 से 3000 पॉइंट का आप लोग बना सकते हैं। अगर आपको थोड़ा सा टाइम फ्रेम के लिए रखना है। स्कैल्पर्स तो ऑब्वियसली उनको आराम से 200300 पॉइंट ऊपर नीचे हर जगह मिल जाता है। फॉर एग्जांपल आप देखिए यहां पर एक वॉल्यूम शिफ्ट आया ये जैसे ही यहां पर ओपन हुआ है टाइम पास किया रेिस्ट रेिस्ट रेजिस्ट अगेन 89900 के आसपास और 89000 से सीधे ये आ गया था 88385 तो इस प्रकार के मौके आपको अभी फिलहाल मिलेंगे मेरे हिसाब से एक बहुत बड़ा स्विंग अपॉर्चुनिटी फिलहाल के लिए नहीं बनता है ऑडलर्स को मैंने लास्ट वीडियो में ऑलरेडी बताया हुआ है सिल्वर वाले वीडियो में कि आपको क्या करना चाहिए टॉकिंग अबाउट इथेरियम एंड बाय द वे डेल्टा एक्सचेंज का लिंक आपको डिस्क्रिप्शन में मिलेगा जो लोग भी यहां पर अकाउंट खोलते उनको फ्री क्रिप्टो ग्रुप का भी हिस्सा बनने मिलता है और साथ में जितने लोग भी यह करते हैं उनको एक बहुत अच्छी लर्निंग अपॉर्चुनिटी मिलती है। तो मेक श्योर आप डिस्क्रिप्शन में दिए गए लिंक से अकाउंट खोल सकते हैं। यहां पर एक और चीज इथेरियम की अगर मैं बात करूं तो आपको ध्यान होगा हमने लास्ट वीडियो में ये चर्चा करी थी कि बिटकॉइन के कंपैरिजन में अगर कोई एक बेटर परफॉर्मर हो सकता है जो आपको रिलेटिवली कम रिस्क पे ज्यादा रिटर्न अगर आपको दे सकता है तो वो इथेरियम होगा। तो मेरी माने तो इथेरियम वुड बी वन एरिया जिस पे आप लोगों को फोकस करना चाहिए। बाकी बचे कॉइंस में Dज इज आल्सो वन थिंग जो मेरे नजर पर आ रहा है। अगर हम Dज कॉइन को टेस्ट करने की कोशिश करते हैं तो आपको यहां पर दिखता है DG कॉइन और Dज कॉइन पे आप लोग एक देख सकते हैं दोस्तों एक बहुत बड़ा डिप होने के बाद कहीं ना कहीं कंट्रोल सिचुएशन पे आने की कोशिश कर रहा है। Dज पे एक्चुअली आपका रिस्क रिवॉर्ड अच्छा बनता है। अगर आपको सही में स्विंग लेने की इच्छा है। आपका जो स्टॉप लॉस हो जाता है वो बहुत ही नियर बाय हो जाता है। ऑलमोस्ट 0.123 के आसपास हो जाता है। अभी 125 चल रहा है। 0.123 के आसपास हो जाता है। और आपका जो टारगेट होगा वो करीब-करीब 0.130 के आसपास हो सकता है। याद रखिए हमेशा स्टॉप लॉस के साथ ही ट्रेड करना चाहिए। और ये केवल डिस्क्लेमर मैं आपको बता रहा हूं। मेरा क्या व्यू है क्रिप्टो मार्केट में स्पेसिफिकली। तो ये सारी चीजें हैं। एंड जैसे कि मैंने बताया डेल्टा एक्सचेंज का लिंक आपको डिस्क्रिप्शन में मिल जाएगा। मेक श्योर आप जाके चेक आउट जरूर कीजिए। चलो अब बात करते हैं उस एसेट की जिसको मैंने अभी आपको स्क्रीन पे दिखाया और जिसको काफी सारे लोग सट्टा मानते थे। पर अब वो अल्टरनेटिव इन्वेस्टमेंट बन चुका है। मैं बात कर रहा हूं क्रिप्टो 2025 में क्रिप्टो के लिए ईयर ऑफ मैच्योरिटी रहा था भारत के कॉन्टेक्स्ट में। 2024 में बिटकॉइन हल्विंग हुई थी और हिस्ट्री गवाह है कि हल्विंग के एक साल बाद यानी 2025 में असली बुल रन आता है और वैसा ही हुआ। द इंडियन कॉन्टेक्स्ट के हिसाब से अगर आप देखते हैं तो टैक्स का डर कहीं ना कहीं थोड़ा खत्म हुआ। इंडिया में 30% टैक्स और 1% टीडीएस का जो भूत था अब लोग उसके साथ जीना सीख गए हैं। डेल्टा एक्सचेंज जैसे प्लेटफार्म फ्यूचर एंड ऑप्शन देते हैं तो यहां पर भी बचत होती है। लोग अब शॉर्ट टर्म ट्रेडिंग नहीं कर रहे हैं क्योंकि टीडीएस प्रॉफिट खा जाता है। अब इंडियन यूथ दो चीजें कर रहा है या तो हॉर्ड कर रहा है या तो बेटर है डेल्टा एक्सचेंज जैसे प्लेटफार्म पे ट्रेड कर रहा है। 2025 में दो बड़े बदलाव हुए। पहला एफआईयू कंप्लायंस जो बहुत ज्यादा जरूरी था। सारे जितने बड़े एक्सचेंजेस थे इंक्लूडिंग डेल्टा एक्सचेंज अब गवर्नमेंट के साथ रजिस्टर हो चुके हैं। ऑफशोर एक्सचेंजेस जो धंधली कर रहे थे उन्हें बाहर निकाल दिया गया है नोटिस देके। इससे इन्वेस्टर्स में कॉन्फिडेंस आया कि चलो पैसा एटलीस्ट डूबेगा तो नहीं कोई तो देखने वाला है। आरडब्ल्यूए दैट इज रियल वर्ल्ड एसेट। 2025 में एक नया वर्ड सुनने को मिला टोकनाइजेशन। अब आप क्रिप्टो के जरिए रियलस्टेट या गोल्ड की फ्रैक्शनल ओनरशिप ले सकते हो। ये ट्रेंड 2026 में फटने वाला है। बी प्रिपयर्ड फॉर दैट। एडवाइस सिंपल सी है कि क्रिप्टो को अभी भी अपने पोर्टफोलियो के मैक्स 10 टू 15% ही रखना चाहिए। ये मेरी पर्सनल एडवाइस है। क्यों? क्योंकि ये वोलेटाइल है। पर इसे इग्नोर करना अब ऑलमोस्ट इंपॉसिबल है। एंड जी हां, अगर आप लोग इग्नोर नहीं कर पा रहे हैं तो जैसे मैंने बताया डेल्टा एक्सचेंज का लिंक डिस्क्रिप्शन में मिलेगा। जाके चेक आउट जरूर कीजिएगा। अब बात करते हैं कमोडिटीज की। सबसे बड़ा सरप्राइज सिल्वर से है। उस एसेट क्लास ने जिसने सबको हिलाया। गोल्ड को भी पीछे छोड़ दिया। जी हां, सिल्वर। दोस्तों, 2025 में सिल्वर सिर्फ एक गहना नहीं रह गया था जिसको लोग पहनते थे। ये ग्रीन एनर्जी का फ्यूल बना। आपको समझना पड़ेगा सोलर स्क्वीज़ हुआ था इंडिया में। तो द सोलर स्क्वीज़ इंडिया का टारगेट है 500 गीगावाट रिन्यूएबल एनर्जी बाय 2030। और इसके लिए लाखों सोलर पैनल्स लग रहे हैं। और हर सोलर पैनल में क्या लगता है? सिल्वर उर्फ चांदनी। दुनिया में सिल्वर की माइनिंग मतलब प्रोडक्शन कम हो रही है और डिमांड बढ़ती जा रही है। इस स्ट्रक्चरल डेफिसिट की वजह से सिल्वर ने इस साल इक्विटी को भी मात दे दिया है। एनालिस्ट ये कह रहे हैं कि ₹2400 पर केजी दूर नहीं है। गोल्ड की अगर मैं बात करूं तो ये एक इटरनल प्रोटेक्टर बन गया। गोल्ड ने अपना काम बखूबी निभाया है। ₹12,000 पर 10 ग्राम का लेवल टच करके गोल्ड ने दिखा दिया कि जब दुनिया में जियोपॉलिटिक्स खराब होती है तब सोना ही काम आता है। आरबीआई ने भी अपने रिजर्व्स में गोल्ड बढ़ाए हैं। जो एक बड़ा सिग्नल है कि फियट करेंसी डॉलर पर भरोसा थोड़ा कम हो रहा है लोगों का। अब बात करते हैं आप लोगों के एज ओल्ड चहेते एरिया की जिसको कहते हैं रियलस्टेट। बट ये एक नया लग्जरी कोड बनाया है। देखिए आपको मैं बताता हूं 2025 का रियलस्टेट मार्केट के शेप्ड रहा था। इसका अर्थ क्या होता है? गरीब और मिडिल क्लास के लिए घर महंगे होते गए पर अमीरों के लिए लग्जरी होम्स की सेल आप जान के शॉक्ड हो जाओगे 50% बढ़े। मतलब इस साल सबसे ज्यादा अगर डिमांड रही तो वो थी लग्जरी घरों की। आपको समझना पड़ेगा जो ये हाई राइज क्रेज था स्पेसिफिकली मुंबई, गुड़गांव और बेंगलुरु में 5 करोड़ प्लस के फ्लैट्स ऐसे बिक रहे थे जैसे कि पता नहीं रस्ते में वड़ा पाव बिक रहा हो। एनआरआई ने भरभर के पैसे भेजे। लोग अब सिर्फ घर नहीं एक्सपीरियंस खरीद रहे हैं और कन्वीनियंस सर्विस होता है, प्राइवेट जिम्स होता है, पूल्स होता है, ग्रीन बिल्डिंग्स होता है। ऐसे में तो वो धनाधन परचेसिंग करते हैं। आपको समझना पड़ेगा कि टायर टू में भी एक राइज देखा गया। असली पैसा वहीं पे था। कोयंबटूर हो गया, सूरत हो गया, इंदौर हो गया, कोची हो गया। ऐसे शहरों में देखा गया। यहां की कमर्शियल प्रॉपर्टी ने लगभग 10 से 12% का रेंटल ईल्ड दिया। हम हिस्टोरिकली 6% की बात करते हैं। यहां पे 10 टू 12% का रेंटल लीड रियल स्टेट इन्वेस्टमेंट ट्रस्ट मतलब रीट्स। अब ये मेन स्ट्रीम बन चुका है। अगर आपके पास 50 करोड़ नहीं है एक बिल्डिंग खरीदने के लिए तो आप ₹500 से भी रीट्स में इन्वेस्ट करके ऑफिस स्पेस के मालिक बन पाते हो। 2025 में रीट्स का वॉल्यूम कितना बना? आप जान के हैरान हो जाओगे। 70% बढ़ गया। व्हिच क्लियरली शोज़ कि लोग अब जो डिजिटलाइजेशन ऑफ़ हार्ड एसेट्स होते हैं ना उसकी तरफ बढ़ते जा रहे हैं। अब बात करते हैं फाइनली 2026 के लिए पर्सनली आपको क्या स्ट्रेटजी होनी चाहिए? पहली चीज़ ये देखिए ये मेरी सिंपल सी राय है। डिस्क्लेमर ये कोई स्टॉक एडवाइस नहीं है। मैं कोई सेबी रजिस्टर्ड इंडिविजुअल नहीं हूं। तो वो सारी चीजें मैं नहीं दे रहा ना। मैं सिर्फ लर्निंग के लिए आपको हेल्प आउट कर रहा हूं। मैं अभी हाल फिलहाल में सिर्फ एक्सचेंज के इधर ऑथराइज्ड पार्टनर हूं। व्हिच इज अगेन रजिस्टर्ड। तो चलिए मैं आपको बताता हूं। पहला इक्विटी किंग है। आरबीआई के रेट कट का फायदा अभी पूरा नहीं मिला है। बैंक्स और कैपिटल गुड्स इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर स्टॉक्स को अभी भी आप पकड़ के रख सकते हो। हर गिरावट पर सिल्वर ईटीएफ या फिजिकल सिल्वर कहीं ना कहीं एक्सपर्ट्स कह रहे हैं एक्यूमुलेट किया जा सकता है। मेरे हिसाब से एसआईपी मोड इज़ मोर कन्वीनिएंट। हम अगर इसकी बात करते हैं क्रिप्टो की अगर मैं बात करूं बिटकॉइन और इथेरियम को थोड़ा-थोड़ा आप एक्यूमुलेट कर सकते हैं ऐज़ अ हॉडलर बिटकॉइन जैसे कि मैंने बताया एटलीस्ट आपको 90 के लेवल के ऊपर जाते हुए दिखना चाहिए तब जाके आप उसमें कॉन्फिडेंस दिखा सकते हैं। अगर फिजिकल घर महंगा लग रहा है तो रीच उर्फ कमर्शियल प्रॉपर्टी में आप लोग घुस सकते हैं। तो दोस्तों 2025 एक इम्तिहा रहा और उसमें हमारा देश के वेरियस एसेट क्लास डिस्टिंशन के साथ पास हुए। 2026 हमारे लिए वेल्थ क्रिएशन का साल होने वाला है। अगर आपको यह एनालिसिस पसंद आई तो नीचे कमेंट्स में जरूर बताइएगा। आप सभी को एडवांस में हैप्पी न्यू ईयर। मैं आशा करता हूं कि आपके इस नए साल में ढेर सारे पैसे बने, प्रोस्पेरिटी बने। इस चैनल को सब्सक्राइब नहीं किया तो सब्सक्राइब कीजिए। बिकॉज़ 2026 में और धमाकेदार वीडियोस एंड पडकास्ट आने वाले हैं। टिल देन कीप लर्निंग, कीप ग्रोइंग।",
  "y6ftnoMUMBo": "दोस्तों कल ससेक्स की एक्सपायरी के लिए जो सबसे इंपॉर्टेंट प्रीमियम्स रहेंगे उस पर हम लोग दोस्तों चर्चा करेंगे। जैसे कि आप लोग देख रहे हो जो Dub jons है उसमें तेजी दिखाई दे रही है। 0.95% दोस्तों Dub Joss ऊपर ट्रेड कर रहा है। क्रूशियल लेवल पे है। देखते हैं यहां से क्या होता है। लेकिन कहीं ना कहीं अगर मार्केट ऐसे ही क्लोज होता है अपसाइड में तो गैप अप ओपनिंग के चांसेस हो सकते हैं। जैसे कि आजकल आप देख रहे हो कि हमारा मार्केट ज्यादा D jons को फॉलो नहीं करता। ओपनिंग भी उसके विपरीत हम लोगों को दिखाई दे जाती है। तो बहुत कुछ दोस्तों यहां पे श्योर शॉट नहीं है। लेकिन फिर भी एक अंदाजा लगा के चलते हैं कि मार्केट बड़ा गैप डाउन तो खुलने नहीं वाला है ए पर द करंट सिनेरियो। राइट? तो यहां पे देखो जैसे कि आप देख ही रहे हो कि जो हमारा ससेक्स है उसने आज भी एक अच्छा रैली दिया। निचले स्तर से एक बहुत अच्छी रैली दिखाई दी और ऊपर से फिर हम लोगों को थोड़ा सा प्रॉफिट टेकिंग इन पर्टिकुलर लेवल से दिखाई देनी शुरू हुई है। अब अगर अभी भी आप लोग देखोगे तो जो हमारा सेंसेक्स है वो एक स्ट्रेंथ के अंदर ट्रेड कर रहा है। तो अगर गैप अप ओपनिंग होती है तो ध्यान रखना है दोस्तों ये जो 8283 का लेवल है एक इंपॉर्टेंट लेवल है। इसके नीचे-नीचे रहा और यह ब्रेकआउट आने के बाद दोबारा से अगर गिरने लगता है दोस्तों तो फिर से होगा यह कि मार्केट इस लो को कट कर देगा जो कि 81800 के नीचे है। अगर यह इसके ऊपर जाता है, यहां कहीं पे जाता है दोस्तों, तो भी आप ध्यान रखिएगा कि आप एक ब्रेकआउट लेवल पे होंगे। और अगर यहां से दोस्तों यह जो ब्रेकआउट है फॉल्स हो जाता है, तो फिर दोबारा से गिरावट के चांसेस यहां पे बढ़ सकते हैं। राइट? तो यहां पे ये जो पर्टिकुलर पॉइंट रहेगा एक रिस्की पॉइंट भी हो सकता है क्योंकि आप देखोगे कि जो ओवरऑल ट्रेंड है वो डाउन ही है। फिलहाल निचले स्तर से हमें बाइंग जरूर दिखाई दिया है। लेकिन बाइंग तभी करके फायदा है जब ये इस पर्टिकुलर स्ट्रेंथ के अंदर कुछ हम लोगों को फॉल्स ब्रेकडाउन दे। राइट? तो यहां पे देखो समझने की कोशिश करते हैं कि कौन से प्रीमियम्स किस तरीके से हम लोग ट्रेड कर सकते हैं। तो यहां पे अगर आप देखोगे कि एक साइड में मैंने उठाया हुआ है दोस्तों 82300 का कॉल। तो ₹82,300 के कॉल को अगर आप देखोगे तो आपको दिखाई दे रहा होगा कि ₹145 पे यह क्लोज होता हुआ दिखाई दिया है। अगर ओपनिंग गैप अप होती है दोस्तों तो हो सकता है ये 325 के आसपास आपको दिखाई दे। तो जब तक यह 325 के नीचे है तब तक हो सकता है दोस्तों कि यह कहीं से भी रिवर्स हो जाए। राइट? तो थोड़ा सा यहां पे ध्यान रखिएगा। अगर 325 के आसपास ये आता है क्योंकि अगर देखो गैप अप ओपनिंग होगी तो ये प्रीमियम जो है सीधा ऊपर खुलता हुआ दिखाई देगा और क्योंकि Dub jos का सेंटीमेंट भी होगा तो कहीं ना कहीं ज्यादातर लोग यही कहेंगे कि हां भाई अब तो मार्केट बुलिश ही रहने वाला है। तो 325 का जो लेवल है इसके नीचे-नीचे ये दोस्तों रिस्की हो सकता है। जब ये इसके ऊपर निकले उसके बाद पुलबैक के बाद ही दोस्तों एक अपसाइड बनेगी। अदरवाइज़ दोस्तों ये रिस्की रहेगा। किसी भी स्थिति में अगर यह 175 के नीचे ट्रेड करना शुरू कर देता है तो चांसेस यही रहेंगे कि यह फिर जाके अपने ये जो लोज़ हैं ₹75 के लोज़ हैं उसको कट कर देगा। ठीक है? और इसमें जो प्रॉपर बाइंग दिखाई देनी चाहिए या हमें बाय करने की सोचनी चाहिए वो तभी करनी चाहिए फिर जब यह अपने लोज़ दोस्तों कट कर दे। तो ₹51 के जो लोज़ हैं ये कट हो जाए या कहीं पे फॉल्स ब्रेकडाउन दिखाई दे। कोई किसी भी लेवल पे हो सकता है। वह 33 पे हो सकता है, 35 पे हो सकता है। और उसके बाद फिर एक कंटीन्यूएशन दोस्तों देखा जा सकता है। लेकिन यह जो 325 वाला लेवल है थोड़ा सा रिस्की रहेगा। तो इस चीज पे आप लोग ध्यान रखिएगा। अब यहां पे देखिए दूसरी जो मेरे सामने जो ऑप्शन दिखाई दे रहा होगा वो आपको दिखाई दे रहा है 82,200 का पुट। देखो 82,200 का पुट क्यों? क्योंकि देखो अगर यहां से हमें गैप अप ओपनिंग दिखाई देती है तो जो हमारा मार्केट है वह 82,300 के आसपास ट्रेड कर रहा होगा। तो अगर 82,300 पे ट्रेड कर रहा है तो जो 82,200 की जो पुट रहेगी दोस्तों वो आउट ऑफ द मनी पुट हो जाएगी और इसमें वैल्यू जो है वो काफी तेजी के साथ टूट सकती है। तो अगर आप देखोगे कि अभी तो यह चल रहा है ₹391 पे। ठीक है? ₹391 काफी दूर है जहां से हम लोग एक्सपेक्ट करेंगे इसको खरीदना। तो अगर आप देखो कि ये निचले स्तर पे आता है दोस्तों और इन किसी लेवल से करीब-करीब ₹100 के लेवल के आसपास से रिजेक्शन लेना शुरू करता है तो यहां से एक दोस्तों अपसाइड इसमें बनती हुई दिखाई दे सकती है क्योंकि देखो एक यहां पे बेस भी है। सेकंडली आप देख रहे हो कि एक स्ट्रेंथ के अंदर हम लोग ट्रेड कर रहे हैं और अगर हमारा जो सेंसेक्स है वो यहां से दोबारा से गिरना शुरू करता है। अगर इस पर्टिकुलर पॉइंट से दोबारा से गिरना शुरू करता है तो हमको ये पता है कि ये दोबारा से दोस्तों इस बेस तक आएगा। और यह जो बेस का हमारा लेवल है वो करीब-करीब अगर आप देखोगे मैं आपको क्लियर कर देता हूं। तो यह जो बेस का लेवल है वह करीब-करीब है दोस्तों 81900 के आसपास। तो अगर यहां से ये गिर के 81,900 भी आ जाता है दोस्तों तो 82,200 का जो प्रीमियम है वो करीब-करीब 300 के आसपास हो जाना चाहिए। तो अगर हम लोग ₹100 के आसपास एंट्री बन जाती है हमारी और यह 81,900 के आसपास आ जाता है, तो इसकी जो इंट्रिंसिक वैल्यू हो जाएगी दोस्तों, वह करीब-करीब 300 के आसपास हो जाएगी। ठीक है? तो यहां पे इस चीज को हमें समझ के चलना है। तो यहां पे ध्यान रखिएगा कि बेस्ट यही रहेगा कि अगर यह नीचे आए थोड़ा सा रिजेक्शन लेना शुरू करे। कई बार बिल्कुल ये काटता है। कई बार नहीं काटता है। थोड़ा सा यहां पे देखना पड़ेगा कि रिजेक्शन आता है नहीं आता। इस रिजेक्शन के बाद फिर हम लोग एक कंटीन्यूएशन के लिए जा सकते हैं। राइट? तो ये एक अच्छी अपॉर्चुनिटी हो सकती है दोस्तों कल के सेशन में। जैसा कि आप देख रहे हो वोलेटिलिटी जो है वो काफी ज्यादा बढ़ गई है और इस वोलेटिलिटी में जो प्राइस के स्पाइक्स हैं वो काफी ज्यादा तेज होंगे। तो ऐसा नहीं है कि यह बहुत ज्यादा स्लो होंगे। हां ये है कि अगर डायरेक्शनल डायरेक्शनल ट्रेड रह रहा है और डायरेक्शन सही है तो मूव्स दोस्तों आते हुए भी दिखाई देंगे। तो अगर हम लोग सही हैं मान के चलिए कि अगर मार्केट को यहां से गिरना ही है तो आप देखोगे कि यह जो मूव रहेगा यह बहुत अच्छा दोस्तों प्ले कर सकता है और अगर मार्केट को ऊपर रहना है फिर क्या करेगा मार्केट 8283 का जो लेवल है वो ही नहीं तोड़ेगा तो फिर वो क्या करेगा या तो बस यहां से ऊपर जाता रहेगा लेकिन अगर इसके नीचे आता है तो फिर चांसेस बहुत ज्यादा हाई हो जाएंगे जो हमारा पुट साइड का ट्रेड है उसके और सीई साइड तभी फायदेमंद रहेगी जब इसके ऊपर आके हमको पुलबक मार्केट देके ऊपर निकले। अदरवाइज दोस्तों यहां पे फिर सीई थोड़ा सा रिस्की रह सकता है। उसके पीछे देखो कारण यही है कि अगर हम लोग यहां जाके सीई खरीदते हैं तो ये काफी ज्यादा एक्सपेंसिव होगा और ऑलरेडी हम लोग देखो डाउन ट्रेंड के अंदर ट्रेड कर रहे हैं। तो ये एक डाउन ट्रेंड ही है। हां ये जरूर है कि आज हम लोगों को बाइंग दिखाई दी है। लेकिन ओवरऑल आप देखोगे जो कैंडल है वो भी कोई अह बहुत ज्यादा इनेटिव कैंडल नहीं है। तो ये एक वीक कैंडल ही है। बहुत ज्यादा इसमें बुलिश मोमेंटम तो दिखाई नहीं देता कि हां भाई फुल ऑन बुलिश ही है। ऊपर से सेलिंग भी हम लोगों को दिखाई दी है। तो यहां पे भी यह काफ़ी ज़्यादा न्यूट्रल है। हां, यह ज़रूर कई बार होता है कि मार्केट जो है अगर फ्लैटिश खुला ऊपर आके खड़ा हो गया, तो यहां से ये थोड़ा सा ऊपर रह सकता है। लेकिन, क्योंकि अगर आप देखोगे एक इंपॉर्टेंट यहां पे देखो एक फैक्टर है जो कि मैं आपको बताना चाहूंगा। तो यहां पे अगर आप देखोगे कि जो मार्केट है उसका जो ब्रेकडाउन लेवल है जो बेस का लेवल है क्लोजिंग बेसिस पे अगर आप देखोगे तो वो है दोस्तों 83172 पे। ठीक है? तो मोस्ट लाइकली मोस्ट लाइकली यह जो हफ्ता रहेगा इसमें यह क्या करेंगे क्योंकि आपको पता ही है कि वीकली कैंडल जो होता है वो तुरंत दोस्तों नहीं ब्रीच हो पाता है और हमारे पास थर्सडे और फिर फ्राइडे दो दिन ही बचे हैं। तो ऐसा मुश्किल होता है कि भाई ग्रीन कैंडल के नीचे जब कोई रेड कैंडल बने तो यहां से एक और रेड ग्रीन कैंडल खींच जाए। बहुत रेयर होता है। ठीक है? हो जाता है लेकिन बहुत रेयर होता है। तो चांसेस यही रहेंगे कि ये कैंडल जो है वो रेड क्लोज होगा। ठीक है? अब इसमें देखो कल तो अपॉर्चुनिटी हम लोगों को दिखाई दे ही सकती है लेकिन उसके बाद एक अपॉर्चुनिटी हमको परसों भी दिखाई दे सकती है। तो ये जो पर्टिकुलर ज़ोन है अगर मार्केट ने मौका दिया इस हाई के ऊपर से ये जो ज़ोन है यहां से फ्राइडे के बाद फ्राइडे को इनफैक्ट एक अच्छी पोजीशन दोस्तों बनती हुई दिखाई दे सकती है जो कि अगले कुछ दिनों में या फिर फ्राइडे ही क्योंकि देखो मोमेंटम है जो विक्स है वो दोस्तों बढ़ रही है। और विक्स को जैसा कि मैंने आपको बताया बजट तक दोस्तों कई बार विक्स 20 तक भी पहुंच जाती है। तो यहां पे अगर विक्स को बढ़ना है तो मार्केट को गिरना पड़ेगा। ठीक है? बढ़ते हुए मार्केट में विक्स नहीं बढ़ती है। बढ़ते हुए मार्केट में विक्स घटती है। तो यहां पे हमें देखना पड़ेगा कि अगर मार्केट बाउंस देता है तो ये जो पर्टिकुलर पॉइंट रहेगा ये एक बहुत अच्छा पॉइंट रहेगा। जहां से अगर एंट्री बन जाए मान लीजिए पुट साइड की एंट्री बन जाए या फिर कोई हैेज एंट्री बन जाए जिसमें एक सी और एक पीई ली जा सके। और अगर यहां तक कोई बैठ जाएगा इस लो तक अगर कोई बैठ जाएगा तो फिर यहां पे बहुत अच्छा दोस्तों काम हो सकता है। रही बात रिस्क की रिस्क उतना ही है दोस्तों जितना हमेशा होता है कि आप कोई भी ट्रेड उठाते हो जो भी आपका स्टॉप लॉस होता है 2030% का हैच पोजीशन के हिसाब से वो आप लगा सकते हो या बेस्ट तरीका ये होता है अगर आप 10 लॉट से काम करते हो तो आप एक-एक लॉट दोस्तों एक सीई और पीई का भी देख सकते हो ये तरीका होता है क्योंकि देखो यहां पे स्टॉप लॉस का कोई मतलब नहीं है। अगर हम यहां पोजीशन बना रहे हैं तो ऑब्वियसली एक पोजीशनल पोजीशन है और वो पोजीशनल पोजीशन अगर चल जाती है तो आप देखोगे यहां से अगर यहां तक मूव आ जाता है ठीक है तो ये एक बहुत बड़ा मूव है जिसको इस टाइम पे क्योंकि ये जो सिनेरियो है जहां पे अब विक्स बढ़ रही है तो आप देखोगे कि मार्केट की जो रेंज है वो बहुत बढ़ जाएगी तो करीब-करीब 2000 पॉइंट की रेंज है तो अगर ये रेंज कैप्चर हो जाती है पूरी की पूरी अगर ये रेंज कैप्चर हो जाती है तो ऐसे में काफी अच्छा दोस्तों होता हुआ दिखाई देता है तो ये चीज़ थोड़ा सा ध्यान रखिएगा अर्जेंट नहीं तुरंत नहीं फ्राइडे को हो सकता है आप लोगों को यह मूव आता हुआ दिखाई दे जाए। तो इस पे थोड़ी सी नजर ज़रूर बना के रखिएगा। ऑब्वियसली अगर भाई देखो अगर सीईपी है और मार्केट वाकई में आपको लगता है रिवर्स हो जाएगा तो वो एक डिफरेंट स्टोरी है। उसमें भी फिर सीई साइड में प्रॉफिट बनता हुआ दिखाई देगा। ठीक है? ये एक अप्रोच है जो कि हाई वोलेट वोलेटाइल ऐज़ में दोस्तों इस्तेमाल किया जाता है। क्योंकि फिर वहां पे क्या होता है? मार्केट मोमेंटम तेज़ दे रहा होता है। जब मोमेंटम तेज़ देता है तो मार्केट जो है मूव फास्ट करता है। ज्यादा दूर तक मूव करता है। चाहे वो ऊपर हो चाहे वो नीचे हो। तो ऐसे में क्या होता है? आपका जो एक साइड का ट्रेड होता है वो काफी बड़े मूव्स दोस्तों हम लोगों को देता हुआ दिखाई देता है। तो वो अप्रोच ऐसी मार्केट के लिए सही है और ये जो मार्केट का कंडीशन होता है इस मार्केट की कंडीशन में वो अप्रोच दोस्तों यूज़ नहीं किया जाता है। ठीक है? तो वो चीज़ आप लोगों को समझ आ गई होगी। तो सीईपीई दोनों पे नजर रखिएगा क्योंकि मार्केट जो है बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट जगह पे है और इंट्रेंसिक वैल्यू के हिसाब से अगर हम देखें तो ये जो 82200 का पुट है इसके नीचे से ही आने के बाद इसमें कुछ वैल्यू क्रिएट होती हुई दिखाई देगी। ठीक है? कहीं से भी आपको फॉल्स ब्रेकडाउन दिखाई दे। इसमें हो सकता है थोड़ा सा नीचे भी आ जाए लेकिन एक अच्छी वैल्यू क्रिएट हो सकती है। 100% नहीं है लेकिन हो सकती है। सीई में जैसे कि मैंने आपको बताया 325 के नीचे-नीचे ये वीक है। इसके ऊपर निकले तो ही पुलबैक के बाद कंटिन्यूएशन के लिए जाना सही रहेगा। अदरवाइज़ तो फिर यहां से इसके नीचे-नीचे तो ये रिस्की दोस्तों है। क्योंकि मार्केट ने क्या किया था? यहां पे एक ट्रैप सेटअप भी करा हुआ है। और अगर यह इसके नीचे रहता है तो कहीं ना कहीं यह जो पूरा का पूरा ट्रैप है यह प्ले में दोस्तों दोबारा से आएगा। क्योंकि मार्केट जो है कन्विंसिंगली अभी यह इन लोज़ के नीचे भी ज्यादा नहीं गया है। तो थोड़ा सा ध्यान रखिएगा। ओवरऑल ट्रेंडिंग डज़ हैं। अब तेज मूव आएंगे उसको थोड़ा संभाल के चलिएगा। क्वांटिटी जो है वो थोड़ी सी रिड्यूस करके रखिएगा। वो दोस्तों सबसे बेस्ट अप्रोच रहेगा। तो आई होप ये वीडियो आप लोगों को पसंद आया होगा। पसंद आया होगा तो चैनल को जरूर सब्सक्राइब करिए। टेक केयर ऑल द बेस्ट। [संगीत] [संगीत]",
  "5I2_CVf7dw4": "जय हिंद। नया साल शुरू हुआ और दूसरे दिन ही भैया निफ्टी ने ऑल टाइम हाई टच कर दिया। बैंक निफ्टी ने ऑल टाइम हाई टच कर दिया। मिड कैप भी जोश में दिखाई दिया। थोड़ा सा स्माल कैप में भी पुल अपक बना। अब सबसे बड़ा सवाल ये है कि भैया 2026 का आउटलुक क्या रहने वाला है? 2025 में निफ्टी स्टार्टिंग में थोड़ा नीचे गया। वापस से ऊपर की तरफ आया। हालांकि पूरे साल में अगर ओवरऑल देखा जाए तो खासा कोई रिटर्न्स प्रोड्यूस नहीं करे। 2026 क्या रहने वाला है? हाय एवरीवन माय नेम इज युर वाशने। आई एम अ सेबी रजिस्टर्ड रिसर्च एनालिस्ट। आज के वीडियो में डिस्कस करने वाले हैं निफ्टी का आउटलुक क्या होगा? लेवल्स क्या बनेंगे? प्रॉपर फिबोनाकी से दिखाऊंगा। बैंक निफ्टी क्या बनेगा? मिड कैप, स्माल कैप और बिटकॉइन, क्रिप्टो में क्या बनने वाला है? विदाउट वेस्टिंग टाइम लेट्स डीप ड्राइवर एनालिसिस। यह आ गई है मेरी स्क्रीन। आज हमारे पास डीजल स्क्रीन नहीं है तो एनालिसिस लैपटॉप पे ही चलेंगे। राइट ना बट यस विदाउट वेस्टिंग टाइम अगर देखो अगर अभी तक आपने चैनल सब्सक्राइब नहीं किया है ना यहां पर आपको सारे टाइप के वीडियोस मिल जाएंगे। तीन एसआईपीओ मैं कौन सी करने वाला हूं 2026 के लिए 16 ऐसे आईपीओ जिनमें शेयर होल्डर कोटा होने वाला है। यूएस मार्केट में कैसे डालें रेलवे स्टॉक्स के ऊपर भरत कोकिंग कोल हीरो फिनरp सब मिल जाएगा ऑन द बोर्ड। शुरू करते हैं निफ्टी के साथ। देखो निफ्टी ने एक छोटा सा अपना राउंड बॉटम तो यहां पर पूरा किया ही किया है। राइट? मोमेंटम देखो कितना स्ट्रांग था। लास्ट तीन-चार दिन में 25,800 से लेकर 26,300 मोटा-मोटा 500 पॉइंट की एक अच्छी खासी मूव आई। अब क्वेश्चन ये बन रहा है कि भ अब निफ्टी ने देखो एक काइंड ऑफ़ अ कप एंड हैंडल का ब्रेकआउट दिया था। एक रफ एंड ड्राइंग अगर मैं यहां पर बनाता हूं। ये कप एंड हैंडल का ब्रेकआउट दिया। फिर वापस से इसको रीिटेस्ट भी करा। अब अपमूव के लिए स्टार्ट हो चुका है। अब क्वेश्चन ये आ रहा है कि अगर हमें निफ्टी के लेवल्स निकालने हैं। देखो गाइस होता क्या है? जब मार्केट ऑल टाइम हाई पर है तो हमारे पास दो तरीके हैं कि कोई भी स्टॉक हो निफ्टी हो बैंक निफ्टी हो दो तरीके हैं। पहला है गै नंबर दूसरा है Fibonacci। Fibonacci के हेल्प से मैं आपको लगा कर भी दिखाऊंगा, प्लॉट करके भी दिखाऊंगा और मैं रिक्वेस्ट करूंगा इस वीडियो के बाद जाकर आप दोबारा से ट्राई करना कि किस तरीके से उसको अप्लाई करते हैं। देखिए हम लोग क्या करने वाले हैं? पहले Fivo की लास्ट ट्रेंड पे लगाएंगे और देखेंगे कि हमारे लेवल्स क्या बनकर आते हैं। जिनमें मैं निफ्टी के लेवल्स क्या एक्सपेक्ट कर रहा हूं। हालांकि आई एम एक्सपेक्टिंग भ क्वार्टर फोर के जो रिजल्ट्स होंगे, क्वार्टर थ्री के जो रिजल्ट्स होंगे वो काफी अच्छे आने वाले हैं। हम जाएंगे यहां पर हम लोगे Fibonacci एक्सटेंशन या Fibonacci रिट्रेसमेंट। यहां से यहां तक Fivo लगाते हैं। अभी ये डॉट टू डॉट नहीं है बट रफ एंड ड्राइंग है। देखिए पहला लेवल यहां पर निकल कर आ रहा है 1.61 पे 26469 राउंड ऑफ में बात करूं तो 26500 के आसपास जो प्रोबेबबली नेक्स्ट वीक तक टच हो जाना चाहिए। उसके बाद 2.61 अगर हम चेक करते हैं तो यहां पर निकल कर आ रहा है 27784 जो प्रोबेबबली फर्स्ट हाफ तक यानी कि जून तक जुलाई तक यानी कि क्वार्टर रिजल्ट जब आएंगे तब टच हो जाना चाहिए। मेजर इंपैक्ट कहां पड़ेगा? भ देखो ये मेजर डिपेंड करता है कि बजट किस टाइप का आने वाला है। हालांकि लास्ट ईयर ऑलरेडी 12 लाख की लिमिट हो गई थी तो लिमिट बढ़ने के चांसेस तो कम है। बाकी देखते हैं इंडस्ट्रीज को क्या मिलेगा। क्या जीएसटी भी रिड्यूस कर रहा है? तो क्या कॉर्पोरेट टैक्स जब एक बार निर्मला कैंडल बनी थी दोबारा बन सकता है या फिर नहीं बन सकता? नेक्स्ट लेवल बहुत दूर है। 29,000 के हो गए और 30,000 के हो गए। हालांकि ये लेवल बहुत दूर है। जर्नी हमेशा ऐसे नहीं रहने वाली है कि स्ट्रेट अवे ऐसे आए। ये जाएगा नीचे आएगा ऊपर जाएगा नीचे ये कब्स ये वो तब जाकर ये एक डेढ़ साल की जर्नी है बट हमारे लिए जो लेवल इंपॉर्टेंट है 26500 और 27800 के आसपास ये दो लेवल नोट करके रखिएगा आप चलते हैं बैंक निफ्टी की तरफ देखो बैंक निफ्टी ने भी यहां पर अपना एक जो स्मॉल राउंड बॉटम था एक जो कंसोलिडेशन फेस चल रहा है ना एक आप चाहो तो यहां पर एक हार्मोनिक बना सकते हो डब्ल्यू बना सकते हो देखो यहां पर मल्टीपल बॉटम्स बने थे जरा एक बार 2 तीन चार पांच बार बैक टू बैक 58700 से बाउंस लेकर गया और तीन चार दिन में बैक टू बैक ग्रीन कैंडल बनी है। ये पहले ही इशारा हो चुका है प्री बजट रैली का कि भ एक अच्छा खासा मोमेंटम तो है ही है। बैंकिंग सेक्टर को काफी अच्छे रिजल्ट्स आने वाले हैं क्वार्टर थ्री में। अब अगर इसके लेवल निकालने वापस से जाएंगे। देखिए हम लोग वीकली चार्ट पे कंप्रेस करके देखते हैं। अब यहां पर एक तरीका एक और है। अगर आप चाहो तो एक ट्रेंड लाइन ये डाल के छोड़ सकते हो। भैया मैं तो हर बार क्या करता हूं? में जब तक ट्रेंड लाइन ब्रेक नहीं होती मोमेंटम इंटैक्ट है। अब हमें लगाना है इस पर fibonak हम जाएंगे वापस से लेटेस्ट ट्रेंड पे जो लास्ट डाउन ट्रेंड था जो लास्ट डाउन ट्रेंड था वो था ये हमने लगाया fibonak और देखिए पहला लेवल आया था यहां पर 6196 राउंड ऑफ करते हैं 6200 जो कि आज एग्जैक्ट डॉट हाई लगा 623 का डॉट हमारा टारगेट टच हो गया हमें अगर और चेक करना है इसके बाद कौन सा टारगेट निकल कर आता है इसके बाद निकल कर आता है 2.6 61 फिबोनाकी इसको बोलते हैं फिबोनाकी एक्सटेंशन। जब आप वापस से रिट्रेस करते हैं सपोज़ अगर कोई स्टॉक ऊपर से नीचे आ रहा है तो हम लोग Fibonacci लगाते हैं और वापस से रिवर्सल है तो हम लोग Fibonak एक्सटेंशन लगाते हैं। यहां पर अब लेवल निकल कर आ रहा है 64278 का मतलब 4000 पॉइंट के आसपास यानी 7 8% के आसपास बैंक निफ्टी और ईजीली मूव दे सकता है। ये जो हम बात करें फर्स्ट हाफ की बात करें बाकी जैसे-जैसे मार्केट मूव करेगा वीकली वीडियोस हो गए या हम लोग अपडेट करते रहेंगे। फिर आएगा मेरे पास 68,000 का लेवल और 72,000 का लेवल यहां पर निकल कर आ रहा है। ये मेरे हो गए चार लेवल जिन पर मैं फोकस करने वाला हूं जिनमें से एक लेवल ऑलरेडी हो चुका है। चलिए दोस्तों अब चलते हैं नेक्स्ट वन पे। लोगों ने पूछा था कि भ बिटकॉइन वगैरह के बारे में कि भाई बिटकॉइन वगैरह ने खासा रिटर्न्स वगैरह नहीं प्रोड्यूस करे हैं। लास्ट एक साल के आसपास भी मैं देखता हूं उल्टा नेगेटिव ही होगा। 90,000 से 88,000 के आसपास आ चुका था। बिटकॉइन की बात करते हैं तो देखिए बिटकॉइन यहां पर ट्रेड कर रहा था 2025 के आसपास अगर मैं यहां पर चलता हूं 92,000 के आसपास जो अभी हम लोगों ने डिस्कस करा और अभी 90000 के आसपास है। ठीक है? अब क्वेश्चन क्या आ रहा है कि भ देखो बिटकॉइन में एक अच्छी चीज क्या बनी है? पहले इसके वॉल्यूम्स ये लाइक नीचे जाकर एक कंसोलिडेशन फज़ में चला गया। ये देखो यहां से 2 महीने हो गए। 1ढ़ पौने दो महीने हो गए जब ये कंसोलिडेशन में है और बहुत ही क्योंकि जबकि बिटकॉइन बहुत एक अच्छा खासा वोलेटाइल आई शुड से एसेट है तब भी ये कंसोलिडेशन फज़ में चल रहा है। अच्छा मैं एक चीज और बता देता हूं। आप चाहें तो जो लोग बिटकॉइन वगैरह में ट्रेड करते हैं। मैं अपना पोर्टफोलियो भी दिखाता हूं। देखो बिटकॉइन ने हालांकि खासा रिटर्न्स प्रोड्यूस नहीं करे हैं। अगर हम लोग लेवल्स वगैरह चेक करते हैं। देखो यहां पर बिटकॉइन ट्रेड कर रहा था फर्स्ट जनवरी के आसपास 91 92,000 के लेवल्स पर और करेंटली ट्रेड कर रहा है 9,000 पे। मतलब ऑलमोस्ट फ्लैट बोला जाए ऊपर गया नीचे आया। अब एक सबसे बड़ी चीज ये है। अच्छा इसमें एक चीज और बताता हूं भाई जो मैं लेवल्स यूज़ करता हूं यानी कि इनसाइड बार ब्रेकआउट हो गया या ब्रेकडाउन वगैरह हो गया। ये सब मैं जो यूज़ करता हूं आप उनको भी यूज़ कर सकते हो सेम पैटर्न्स वगैरह के लिए। जैसे मैं कुछ दिखाता हूं यहां पर। यहां पर अगर हम देखेंगे तो देखो इंसाइड बार ब्रेकआउट आ रहा है डेली चार्ट पे। यहां पर लास्ट टाइम मैं मार्क भी कर देता हूं। ये करंट वाला है। लास्ट टाइम यहां पर ब्रेकडाउन वगैरह आया था। अगर आप लोग इंट्राडे में ट्रेड कर रहे हो तो 5 मिनट का चार्ट या 15 मिनट का चार्ट यूज़ कर सकते हो ट्रेड करने के लिए। जैसे मैं लास्ट टाइम जो मैंने कैप्चर करा था यहां पर 5 मिनट का चार्ट में देखो ब्रेकडाउन आया था और इमीडिएटली यहां पर स्लिप हो गया था 5000 5000 पॉइंट्स के आसपास अभी तक फॉल आ चुका अब क्वेश्चन ये आता है कि भाई मैं ट्रेड कैसे करूं कहां पर करूं देखिए मैं ट्रेड करता हूं कॉinडीx वगैरह के साथ ये मेरा एक पोर्टफोलियो है जहां पर मैंने टोटल पीएनएल अभी तक आप देख सकते हो यहां पर 13000 के गेंस बनाए थे इंट्राडे में मुझे आज 5000 के आस आसपास प्रॉफिट हुआ था और 5000 के आसपास ही मुझे लास्ट वीक के आसपास प्रॉफ़िट हुआ था। यहां पर आपको सारी जानकारी मिल जाएगी। देखो मैंने यहां पर किस-किस में ट्रेड करा। मैंने टॉन में ट्रेड करा। BTC लाइट Meril हो गया। वीवी और किसी में प्रॉफिट हुआ। किसी में लॉस जैसे टॉन में मुझे अच्छा खासा प्रॉफिट हुआ। बिटकॉइन कॉस्ट टू कॉस्ट के आसपास चल रहा है। लाइट में मुझे थोड़ा सा प्रॉफिट हुआ। मेरिल में लॉस हुआ और बाकी टाइनी-टाइनी से चल रहे हैं। अब यहां पर गौर करने वाली बात क्या है कि भाई देखो बिटकॉइन चल रहा है ₹900 के आसपास तो क्या इतना सारा पैसा चाहिए? नहीं कॉinडीx में ट्रेड करने के लिए आपको सिर्फ ₹100 चाहिए। ₹100 से आप इजीली स्टार्ट कर सकते हो। कॉinडीx इंडिया का लार्जेस्ट क्रिप्टो एक्सचेंज और ट्रेडिंग प्लेटफार्म है। सबसे बेस्ट पार्ट क्या है कि भ ये हर महीने अपने ऑडिटेड प्रूफ ऑफ रिजर्व्स भी दिखाते हैं। जिनको आप इजीली 1 1 भी वेरीफाई कर सकते हो। कॉइन डी6 एफआईयू के साथ रजिस्टर्ड भी है। मतलब कि मेरा जो पैसा है वो पूरा का पूरा सेफ है। प्रूफ ऑफ रिजर्व्स जिसकी मैं बात कर रहा था। सबसेेंट पॉइंट ये है कि मान लीजिए रात के 12:00 बज रहे हैं, 1:00 बज रहा है, 2:00 बज रहा है। अगर मुझे डिपॉजिट्स करने हैं या विथड्रॉल्स वगैरह करने हैं तो क्या प्रॉब्लम है? कोई प्रॉब्लम नहीं है। 24 /7 इनका कस्टमर केयर भी अवेलेबल है। और 24/7 इनका विथड्रॉल्स और डिपॉजिट्स भी अवेलेबल है। सबसे बेस्ट पार्ट क्या है कि अगर मान लीजिए मुझे कुछ भी ट्रेड करना है लीवरेज। सबसे बेस्ट पार्ट है कि आपको यहां पर एक अच्छी खासी लीवरेज मिल जाती है। अगर आपको फ्यूचर्स वगैरह में ट्रेड करना है। बाकी अगर मैं यहां पर कॉइंस पे क्लिक करता हूं तो आप देखेंगे यहां पर सारा स्प्रेड हो गया। चार्ट्स वगैरह हो गए। उसी टाइम में आईएआर में भी मिल जाते हैं। अगर आपको डॉलर्स वगैरह में चाहिए तो आप यहां से जाके डॉलर्स वगैरह में भी स्विच कर सकते हो। बीटीसी वगैरह मुझे बताओ कि भैया अगर मैं यहां पर करेंटली देख रहा हूं तो 82 थाउजेंड 8 लाख नॉट 82,000 के आसपास तो डॉलर्स वगैरह में था। राइट? यहां पर सारे स्प्रेड्स वगैरह पता लग जाते हैं। अब क्वेश्चन ये आता है कि भाई मैं इसमें अकाउंट वगैरह कैसे ओपन करूं? मेरे लिंक से अगर आप अकाउंट ओपन करते हैं तो आपको 20% तक ब्रोकरेज पे डिस्काउंट वगैरह भी मिल जाएगा। लोएस्ट ब्रोकरेज ऑलरेडी ऑफर कर रहे हैं। अभी जाइए कॉin को एक्सप्लोर कीजिए और अपनी क्रिप्टो जर्नी स्टार्ट कीजिए। चलिए हम वापस आएंगे। अब इसके बाद स्माल कैप के चार्ट में क्या हुआ? तो पहले मिड कैप का देख लेते हैं। फिर स्माल कैप की बात करते हैं। देखो यहां पर आज मिड कैप ने भी ऑल टाइम हाई लगा दिया। इसके वीकली चार्ट का स्ट्रक्चर देखते हैं और कहां तक जा सकता है। क्या कोई पैटर्न बन रहा है वीकली चार्ट में वो चेक करते हैं। देखिए यहां पर बैक टू बैक बना था हैमर। बैक टू बैक दो हैमर बने थे। राइट? उसके बाद एक ग्रेव स्टोन बना बट इसको कोई फॉलो अप नहीं मिला और वॉल्यूम्स भी आज अच्छे खासे बने हैं। अगर हम यहां पर fivo लगाकर देखते हैं कि भाई लास्ट डाउन ट्रेंड ये था यहां पर fibo के बाद क्या मोमेंटम बन सकता है। ये वो आ गया थोड़ी सी रफ एंड ड्राइंग है। डॉट टू डॉट तो नहीं है और देखिए पहला लेवल निकल कर आ रहा है मेरे पास 62643 का। उसके बाद लेवल निकल कर आ रहा है 66000 का। मोमेंटम ईजीली मुझे दिखाई दे रहा है कि यहां पर भी एक इनवर्टेड हेड एंड शोल्डर बोला जा सकता है। अगर मैं एक ड्रॉ करता हूं तो कुछ इस तरीके से इनवर्टेड हेड एंड शोल्डर था। ये रीिटेस्ट वाला पॉइंट था और उसके बाद वापस से अपनी जर्नी ऊपर स्टार्ट कर रहा है। स्मॉल कैप के स्ट्रक्चर की बात करते हैं तो देखो स्माल कैप ने बिल्कुल भी मूव नहीं दिया। बट एक अच्छी बात है कि यहां पर भी सेम स्ट्रक्चर था। वीकली चार्ट में इनसाइड बार बना और यहां पर अब जाकर डाउन ट्रेंड में डाउन ट्रेंड में एक हैमर बना। ड्रैगन फ्लाई बनी है। 17830 पे ट्रेड कर रहा है। मैं बोलता हूं अगर यहां पर दो लेवल मार्क करते हैं। Vivo नहीं लगाते एक पहला लेवल ये हो गया 19000 के आसपास। दूसरा लेवल हो गया 19,800 के आसपास। तो अगर यहां से भी मोमेंटम बनता है। जर्नी कुछ इस तरीके से चलती है। अगर यहां पर जाकर भी टाइम लगाकर भी ऊपर आता है तो भी मेरे पास आप चाहो तो यहां पर एसआईपी के बेसिस पे इन्वेस्ट कर सकते हो या फिर लमसम में भी इन्वेस्ट कर सकते हो। ये जो व्यू है ये शुरू के 4 महीने 6 महीने के आसपास है। बाकी डिपेंड करता है भाई बजट कैसा आता है। कोई अगर शॉर्ट टर्म कैपिटल गेन लॉन्ग टर्म कैपिटल गेन एसटी बढ़ा दिया तो डेफिनेटली मार्केट को एक जर्क लग सकता है। एंड यस जैसा मैंने आपको क्रिप्टो के बारे में बताया यहां पर आप कॉइन D6 पे जाके अपनी जर्नी स्टार्ट कर सकते हैं। एफआईयू रजिस्टर्ड है। लोएस्ट ब्रोकरेज ऑफर करते हैं और कहते हैं सिर्फ आप ₹100 से अपनी जर्नी स्टार्ट कर सकते हैं। लिंक डिस्क्रिप्शन पिन कमेंट में अभी जाइए क्रिप्टो में जर्नी स्टार्ट कीजिए। वीडियो यूज़फुल लगा हो, प्रोडक्टिव लगा हो, शेयर विद योर फ्रेंड्स, लाइक एंड सब्सक्राइब। थैंक यू फॉर वाचिंग द वीडियो। लॉट्स ऑफ लव। [संगीत] [संगीत]",
  "HJ9RsuCiNI8": "अच्छा अब लास्ट में मैं एक बार फाइनेंस मार्केट को फिर से आपसे डिस्कस कर लेता हूं। अह जो इन्वेस्टर्स हैं जिनके पास अभी पैसा है उनके पास इन्वेस्टमेंट के लिए तीन-चार सेक्टर्स होते हैं मोटे-मोटे तौर पर कि वो मेटल्स ले लें यानी कि प्रिशियस मेटल में चले या सिल्वर गोल्ड ले लें। दूसरा होता है स्टॉक मार्केट में कहीं इन्वेस्ट कर दें। तीसरा है म्यूच्यूल फंड्स, एसआईपी इस तरीके की कोई स्कीम में इन्वेस्ट कर दें। चौथा है प्रॉपर्टी में इन्वेस्ट कर दें। 2026 किस सेक्टर में इन्वेस्टमेंट के लिए सबसे बेस्ट है? तुषार पहले तो हम इंडिविजुअल बेस की बात करेंगे। जो आपने क्वेश्चन पूछा उसमें इंडिविजुअल बेस भी आ रहा है। बिकॉज़ हर व्यूअर्स अकेला बैठा है घर पे। हमारे और आपकी बातें सुन रहा होगा। तो ये बात पूरे लोगों की नहीं आ रही है कि 2026 में क्या करना चाहिए। हम डिपेंड ऑन योर ओन चार्ट। ओके? आपकी अपनी कुंडली क्या कहती है कि आपका लक किस चीज में है। अब व्यूअर्स समझ गए होंगे मेरी बात सुन के। कई लोग ऐसे भी होंगे जो पिछले 20 वर्षों से खूब तपस्या चल रही होगी। अच्छे-अच्छे शेयर्स लेते होंगे। जो भी शेयर लेते होंगे वो डूब जाते होंगे और अपने पड़ोसी को भी देखते होंगे कि यार ये बंदा शेयर लेता था ₹2 का वो 2000 का हो गया है पेनी स्टॉक और मैंने लिया था ₹500 का वो उठ के ₹50 में आ गया मैं उसने ले ली है Rollsy और मैं अपनी पुरानी Maruti 800 पे ही चल रहा हूं डेट में ये हो क्यों रहा है बिल्कुल डिपेंड ऑन योर चार्ट आपकी कुंडली का फिफ्थ हाउस क्या कह रहा है फिफ्थ हाउस का एट्थ 11थ नाइंथ सेकंड के साथ कनेक्शन क्या बन रहा है नक्षत्रों का एक्सचेंज क्या हुआ है सर्पभद्र चक्र में क्या रेशो बनके आ रही है यह बताता है आपको कि आपको अपना पोर्टफोलियो क्या बनाना चाहिए और हमारे जैसे क्योंकि आई एम ए फाइनेंसियल एस्ट्रोलॉजर जी एंड मैं स्टॉक मार्केट एस्ट्रोलॉजी की मेरी पकड़ है पिछले 25 वर्षों से तो जब भी कोई क्लाइंट आते हैं तो हम उनके एक गाइडलाइन देते हैं कि आपको गोल्ड इतना परसेंट लेना चाहिए। आपको स्टॉक्स कौन सी इंडस्ट्री स्टॉक में भी मतलब ये नहीं कि आप कोई सी भी स्टॉक ले लीजिए। आपको डिफेंस कितना पकड़ना है? एफएमसीजी कितना लेना है? ये सेक्टर अभी बढ़ेंगे। जी। एआई को कितना आपको रेशो लेके चलनी है अपने पोर्टफोलियो में? एंड आपको इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर कितना परसेंट ऐड करना है? बैंकिंग कितना परसेंट ऐड करना है? केमिकल सेक्टर कितना ऐड करना है? शिपिंग इंडस्ट्री को कितना ऐड करना है? साथ में देखिए मैंने इंडस्ट्रीज भी व्यूअर्स को बता दी है। ये इंडस्ट्रीज ग्रोइंग इंडस्ट्रीज है आने वाले टाइम में। तो ये रेशियो बताई जाती है और अब इसमें यह भी है कि कौन से वाले शेयर्स लेने हैं एक्सक्ट्ली सेक्टर से ये नहीं कि आपने डिफेंस में कुछ भी उठा के बैठ गए हो और आपने मेरे जैसे एस्ट्रोलॉजर को बोल दिया भाई प्रशांत कपूर ने तो कहा था मंगल की महादशा आएगी तो डिफेंस 2032 तक 10 टाइम हो जाएगा जो हो जाएगा लेकिन सारे थोड़ी नहीं हो जाएंगे कुछ गिरेंगे भी तो सही कुछ कंपनियां बंद भी तो होंगी जो गलत गलत काम कर रही होंगी तो वो तो आपका या तो फाइनेंसियल एडवाइजर बताएगा या तो कोई हमारे जैसे एस्ट्रोलॉजर जिसकी डीप रिसर्च होगी वो बता देगा कि भ ये वाले जो शेयर्स हैं ये काफी बड़ा राइज देंगे आने वाले टाइम में क्योंकि इन इंडस्ट्रीज की एस्ट्रोलॉजिकल चार्ट यह बनते हैं क्योंकि दोनों दो वे होते हैं एस्ट्रोलॉजर के पास स्टडी करने का एस्ट्र आपका एस्ट्रोलॉजिकल चार्ट कि कंपनी किस समय फॉर्म हुई थी कंपनी की कुंडली आगे क्या कह रही है एंड दूसरा कंपनी का पोर्टफोलियो साथ में हमारे साथ रिसर्च एनालिस्ट भी होते हैं जो दोनों रिसर्च हम मिलाके करते फंडामेंटल क्या करें फंडामेंटल ये नहीं कि एस्ट्रोलॉजिकली देख लिया फंडामेंटल रिसर्च ही नहीं किया आपका तो दोनों चीजों को ऐड करके देखना पड़ेगा तब आपको डिसाइड करना करना पड़ेगा कि आपको पोर्टफोलियो में ऐड क्या करना है। बिल्कुल। सिल्वर कितनी लेनी है, गोल्ड कितना लेना है? आपको फ्यूचर लेना है, ऑप्शन लेना है, कॉल लेनी है, पुट लेनी है, आपको कितना क्या रेशियो लेनी है? जी क्योंकि फ्यूचर एंड ऑप्शंस में 99% लोग डूब जाते हैं। हम इंट्राडे करना है, डिलीवरी लेनी है, पोज़्शन ट्रेड लेना है। तुषार जी हर बंदे का इंडिविजुअल चार्ट एक अलग केस बनता है। और वो अलग केस बताता है कि आपको किस तरीके से काम करना है। और सबसे बड़ी बात कि आपको स्टॉक मार्केट में रहना भी है। ये भी क्वेश्चन आता है कुंडली देखकर। ऐसे भी मेरे पास कई बार लोग आते हैं व्हेन आई प्रोवाइड कंसीडरेशन। तो मैं बता देता हूं कि भ दिस मार्केट इज़ नॉट फॉर यू। हम आप कुछ और कर लीजिए। आप फिक्स्ड डिपॉज़िट ले लीजिए। जमीन में इन्वेस्टमेंट कर दीजिए। बिज़नेस का एक्सपेंशन किसी और तरीके से कीजिए। लेकिन स्टॉक मार्केट से दूर रहिए। क्योंकि मान लीजिए कोई पर्टिकुलर शेयर आपने लिया और मैंने लिया। जी। और बराबर क्वांटिटी में आपने भी ले लिया, मैंने भी ले लिया। अगले 10 वर्षों में जरूरी नहीं कि जितना पैसा मैंने उससे कमाया, आपने भी उतना कमाया। हो सकता है कि आपका बीच में मन बदल जाए, आप बेच दें। गलत टाइम पे आपने बेच दिया और मैं ना बेचूं सही टाइम पर आपको अचीवमेंट और आप मुझे बाद में कह रहे यार प्रशांत जी मैंने तो बेच दिया था भाई आप मुझे भी बता देते देखिए आपका तो इतना 100 टाइम बढ़ गया और मैंने तो मैं छोटा सा प्रॉफिट लेके बाहर आ गया था यही तो है ग्रहों की चाल ग्रह आपका वो कहते हैं ना मति माइंडसेट पैसा कर देंगे या मति भ्रम कर देते हैं कई बार आप छोटे से प्रॉफिट में कई बार बाहर निकल जाते हैं ऐसे बहुत सारे केसेस हैं मेरी लाइफ के ऐसे तो बहुत सारे अभी ट्रेडर्स होंगे जो ऐसा सोच रहे होंगे कि जैसे ही मैंने अपनी स्क्वायर ऑफ की पोजीशन वहीं से भाग गया मार्केट भाग गया और वो इस बात को कोसते भी हैं कि जब जब निकालता हूं तभी भाग जाता है मार्केट। अभी जैसे मैं कंसीडरेशन देता हूं स्टॉक मार्केट एस्ट्रोलॉजी या फाइनेंसियल एस्ट्रोलॉजी तो मैं कुंडली से लोगों को बता देता हूं कई बार कि वर्ष में अगर उनकी कुंडली में योग बना है कि फ्यूचर एंड ऑप्शन से वो पैसा बेहतरीन कमा सकते हैं या पुट लेने से क्योंकि फ्यूचर में बहुत पैसा बनता है। बिल्कुल। तो उन्हें हम यह बता देते हैं कि आपको वो कौन से दिन है वर्ष में या कौन से समय हैं जब आपको कुछ नहीं करना है। बस चिल मारो आप। आप सिस्टम बंद करो, गाड़ी उठाओ या वर्ल्ड ट्रेवल करो। चार छ महीने एंजॉय करो और साल में सिर्फ तीन से चार महीने ही काम करो। हम तो ये प्रेडिक्शनंस होती हैं कैस्ट्रोलॉजिस्टर्स की। ये नहीं आप पूरा वर्ष काम करो। रात को नंबर घूमते रहें। आप इंसोमिया के पेशेंट बन जाए। स्लीपिंग डिसऑर्डर हो जाए। कोलेस्ट्रॉल आपका हाई, बीपी हाई टेंशन में कि यार अब क्या होगा? आज तो मैंने 50 लाख गवा दिए, 5 करोड़ गवा दिए। अब कल कैसा दिन होगा? कल मैं बनाऊंगा नहीं बनाऊंगा। आज सारे फंड्स तोड़ के सारे लगा देते हैं। कल पता चला कल फिर डूब गए। तो इस तरह की तरह से हमारे जैसे फाइनेंसियल एस्ट्रोलॉजर लोगों को एडवाइस देते हैं कि भाई आपको रहने कितने दिन हैं आपको इस मार्केट में। बिल्कुल। कई ऐसे भी क्लाइंट है मेरे जिनको मेरी एडवाइस होती है साल में मात्र 40 दिन ही मैं कहता हूं कि भ ये आपको दिन सूट करते हैं। अब आप देख लीजिए इन 40 दिनों में क्या करेंगे और वो हमेशा बताते हैं कि उन 40 दिनों में वो बहुत बेहतरीन पैसा कमा के निकले हैं। अब वो कहते हैं बाकी दिन क्या करें? मैंने कहा भ बाकी अपना दिमाग लगाइए। योगा कीजिए, एक्सरसाइज कीजिए। एंजॉय कीजिए। जो पैसा कमाया है उसका यूज़ करिए। यस। क्योंकि तुषार उपभोग हर व्यक्ति नहीं कर सकता। सही बात है। प्रकृति के मैंने कुछ देखा है। कुछ लोगों को ना एक ब्लेसिंग्स नहीं एक कर्स ही मानिए कि कई लोगों को देखा मैंने बहुत पैसा है लोगों के पास उपभोग नहीं कर पाते वो लोग बड़ा है पैसा किसी साल मुझे मेरा एस्ट्रोलॉजिकल चार्ट देखकर एक एस्ट्रोलॉजर ने कहा कि इस साल तुम्हारा खर्चा बहुत होगा तो मैंने कहा कोई दिक्कत नहीं अच्छी बात ये है कि खर्चा होगा इसका मतलब है मैं कमाऊंगा भी खूब यस तो ठीक है अगर खर्चा हो रहा है और अच्छी जगह हो रहा है तो बहुत अच्छी बात है मैं खूब खर्च करूं बस उस उतना आता रहना चाहिए तो ये उपभोग वाली बात बहुत सही है आपकी बाकी जो लोग स्टॉक मार्केट से जुड़े हुए हैं जो घर में बैठ के इंट्राडे वगैरह करते डेली फ्यूजन अडॉप्शन उनके लिए मैं मैसेज भी देना चाहूंगा कि सबसे पहले दो तीन टिप्स एज ए मेडिकल एस्ट्रोलॉजर अपनी हेल्थ का ये लोग ख्याल रखें हम इनके लिए बहुत जरूरी है कि डेली कम से कम जिम जाते हैं अच्छी बात है लेकिन कम से कम एक से दो घंटे खेलें चाहे बैडमिंटनेंस कॉश एनीथिंग बर्न करें कम से कम दो से 3000 कैलोरीज को बर्न करें 6 घंटे की डेडिकेटेड जॉब होती है लगातार बैठना तो सर ये लोग सवा5 बजे बैठते हैं सुबह अगर भारतीय मार्केट की बात करूं एंड 3:20 पे उठते सीट से उठ नहीं सकते लोग। चार बड़ी-बड़ी स्क्रीन सामने होती है इनके। एंड एकदम आइस फोकस कि यह क्या हो रहा है? नहीं हो रहा है। और यू नो धीरे-धीरे एक सिपसिप करके पानी निकलने वाशरूम में नहीं जा सकते आप बीच में क्योंकि अगर आप 30 सेकंड भी आप गायब हो गए तो धड़ाम कुछ भी हो जाएगा। नहीं उसके बावजूद भी लक इतना खराब होता है कि आप तो भी खराब हो जाता है और सेहत इतनी खराब होती है क्योंकि मैं हमेशा इतना शूट अप होता है जितना इन लोगों को मैं जानता हूं आज भी 30 वर्ष के लोगों को मैंने देखा है जो बॉडी एजिंग है वो 60 70 वर्ष जैसे लोगों की हो गई है इनकी और पैसा अकाउंट में 50000 करोड़ बना लिया है लेकिन छोटे से सिस्टम में बैठे हैं ना सुबह नहाते हैं ना धोते हैं ना पूजा ना पाठ ना स्पोर्ट्स कुर्सी पकड़ी बस वो जंक फूड खा रहे हैं तो मैं पूछता हूं भाई कि कमाओगे किस लिए कि क्यों बना रहे हो इतना पैसा जब आप उपभोग नहीं कर पा रहे हो अपने शरीर को भी स्वस्थ नहीं रख पा रहे हो कोई पैसे कोई फायदा नहीं है उस पैसे का हम तो एक मैसेज है सर ऐसे लोगों के लिए कि भाई पहले तो शरीर स्वस्थ रखो क्योंकि शरीर सबसे बड़ा धन है हमारा हम अच्छा प्रॉपर्टी में इन्वेस्टमेंट ये कैसा रहेगा प्रॉपर्टी सेक्टर बहुत ह पे है कोविड के बाद से लगातार इसमें आप देखते हो कुछ अच्छा अभी और राइज है या थोड़ा फॉल है देखिए प्रॉपर्टी सेक्टर कोविड के बाद राइज हुआ था अह उसकी प्रेडिक्शन हम पहले दे चुके हैं। अब लेटेस्ट प्रेडिक्शन पे आ जाते हैं। तो 28th ऑफ जुलाई को हम मंगल की जो ट्रांजिट हुई थी कन्या राशि में जी। अब ये ट्रांजिट बढ़ती जा रही है। हम अब मंगल अभी स्कर्पियो में भी चले गए हैं 27th अक्टूबर को अभी और ये रहेंगे सेवंथ ऑफ दिसंबर तक। ठीक है। 28 जुलाई के बाद कोई माने या ना माने ये वीडियो मैंने दिया था आज से छ सात माह पहले। प्रॉपर्टी मार्केट टूटना शुरू हो चुकी है। ओके। अब बाकी व्यूअर्स से मेरी रिक्वेस्ट है कि मैसेज करना शुरू कर दें कि आपकी क्या अंडरस्टैंडिंग बैठ रही है। बिकॉज़ मेरे एस्ट्रोलॉजिकल एनालिसिस है मंडे इन एस्ट्रोलॉजी के ऊपर आते रहेंगे। हम और ये सिलसिला चलेगा मिड अप्रैल तक। ठीक है? मार्केट अभी नीचे गिरेगी अभी प्रॉपर्टी की मार्केट। तो 25 से 30% प्रॉपर्टी के रेट अभी करेक्शन होगी इसमें। ठीक है? तो जो लोग सेलर्स हैं हम अब देखिए जब सेलर बायर की डिमांड आती है मार्केट में तो सेलर बेचना ही नहीं चाहता। वो सोचता है कि भ मुझे पुराना रेट चाहिए। हम पुराने रेट उसे मिलेगा नहीं। और रही बात बयरर्स देखिए जब भी कोई नीचे उतार-चढ़ाव होते हैं प्रॉपर्टी गिर रही है तो भी किसी को फायदा है। बिल्कुल तो किसी को नुकसान है। किसी को तो फायदा होगा ही होगा ना बीच में। तो जो इस समय बायरर्स हैं उनके लिए एक मैसेज है कि उन्होंने अभी तक अपना घर नहीं बनाया है। फॉर देम दिस इज द बेस्ट टाइम। घर जहां अच्छा रेट मिले आप ले लीजिए कैप्चर चीजें जहां भी आपको लगता है लेना है ले लीजिए थोड़ा सा रुकना है तो जनवरी फरवरी तक ले लीजिए अभी 10% 15% और तब तक रेट गिरना शुरू हो जाएंगे ओके तो ये है रियल स्टेट का रुख लेकिन अगले वर्ष जैसे ही अगस्त का माह आएगा अगस्त 2026 प्रॉपर्टी के रेट फिर राइज होंगे ओके यस यानी कि अगर आप और सबसे बड़ी बात कि अगर किसी को इन्वेस्टमेंट ही करना है प्रॉपर्टी के अंदर तो नेक्स्ट ईयर तक रुक जाए क्योंकि उसके बाद इन्वेस्टमेंट करेंगे तो एक जो राइज है वो आप फिर से कैप्चर कर पाएंगे। देखिए अभी ना वो टाइम चला गया अगर हम भारत की बात करें अगर कोई यह सोचे कि प्रॉपर्टी में इन्वेस्टमेंट करना है आपको नहीं ये कोई सही निर्णय नहीं होगा आज की डेट में कि आप मल्टीपल फ्लैट ले लें रेंट रेंटिंग इनकम पर जाएं हम शनि देव जी मीन राशि पे गुरु कर्क राशि पे गाज गिनने वाली है गवर्नमेंट कोई ऐसे ऐसे नियम लेके आ जाएगी भ आपके पास चार फ्लैट हैं तो आपको इतना टैक्स पे करना पड़ेगा ओके ठीक है आपको रेंट इतना आ रहा है तो टैक्स आपका बढ़ जाएगा ट्रबल लोगों के लिए ज्यादा होगी की तो बेटर है कुछ और प्लानिंग कर लीजिए और अगर फिर भी कई लोग ऐसे हैं इफ दे आर रेडी टू पे टैक्स और वह भी लीगल तरीके से क्योंकि कई लोग आज भी कैश में काम करते हैं उन लोगों के लिए मेरा मैसेज है कि भाई अभी गुरु जी आ गए हैं कर्क राशि में मतलब आने वाले हैं पूर्ण तरीके से नेक्स्ट ईयर हम शनि मीन राशि में हम अब मुझे याद है 2024 में वीडियो दिया था मैंने कि फरवरी 2025 के आसपास ओके करेंसी में कोई नए रिफॉर्म्स आएंगे करेंसी ₹500 की भी टूटने की कगार पर होगी और पॉसिबिलिटी यह भी दिखाई थी मैंने कि करेंसी हो सकता है हमारे देश में खत्म ही हो जाए। ऐसे योग बन रहे हैं। मुझे मालूम है अब आपके व्यूअर्स और पूछेंगे कि भाई ऐसा तो हुआ ही नहीं। यही तो बात है जो हम बात कर रहे थे ना ऑपरेशन सिंदूर की दिखाई नहीं दे रहा है लोगों को। हम आई एम वेरी कॉन्फिडेंट कि फरवरी 2025 के बाद ही भारत सरकार ने इसके ऊपर काम करना शुरू कर दिया है। ओके? और 2026 27 में कब गाज गिरेगी पता ही नहीं चलेगा। आपको पता चलेगा कि करेंसी फिनिश्ड फ्रॉम द मार्केट। ओके। आपको कोई ऐसे ऐप वगैरह सिस्टम दे दिया जाएगा कि भाई ये तुम्हारी डिजिटल करेंसी है। आ जाओ इस आरबीआई इज़ वर्किंग ऑन दिस। हां सुना था मैंने न्यूज़ लेकिन अभी काम चल रहा है। कैसे करेंगे? अभी कोई पक्का पता भी नहीं है। लोगों के पास कैश भी तो है ब्लैक। बिल्कुल। तो आने वाला जो समय है ना भारत में वो ब्लैक वाला काम है ही नहीं। तो लोगों के लिए मैसेज है कि ब्लैक मनी पड़ी है। डाल दीजिए बैंक में शांति से नींद लीजिए। बढ़िया सी इन सोमनिया भी नहीं होगा। एटलीस्ट आधे से ज्यादा पैसा बच जाएगा। 40 45% का आई थिंक रूल है जहां आप उसको ब्लैक में वाइट में कन्वर्ट कर सकते हैं। कर दीजिए बैंक को जाइए सबमिट करवाइए। आईटीआर फाइल करवा दीजिए कि भ हमने पूरा वाइट बना लीजिए कि बना लिया है। टेंशन क्यों भरनी है? सही बात है। उसी पैसे को बढ़िया से इन्वेस्टमेंट कर दीजिए। आज की डेट में वही पैसा आपका फिर डबल हो जाएगा। ट्रिपल हो जाएगा। बिल्कुल। तो ये मैसेज है क्योंकि अभी गुरु अगले वर्ष गुरु राजा मंगल सेनापति करेक्शंस घरों के अंदर होना शुरू होंगी। ओके। ठीक है। सरकारें आपसे जो गलत चीज है वो खींच के ले जाएंगी। ओके। यानी कि अब आपका बचना थोड़ा मुश्किल हो जाएगा और यह जो समय है वो लगातार और टफ होता जा रहा है इन सारी चीजों को लेकर। सो ये बहुत अच्छा समय है। अच्छा भी समय है और कहीं ना कहीं कुछ लोगों के लिए खराब भी समय है। तो रिफॉर्म्स जब होते हैं तो आपने कहा कि किसी को फायदा किसी को नुकसान होता ही है बहुत सारी चीजों में।"
