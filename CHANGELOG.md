## [2.3.0] - 2025-12-26 - **TRAILING STOP FIX & WEBHOOK IMPROVEMENTS**

### 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIXES**

- **Trailing Stop Now Working** (`core/engine.py`)
  - Fixed critical bug where trailing stop was never actually working
  - Root cause: `state` dict was recreated fresh each bar, losing `entry_price` and `highest_high`
  - Solution: Added `persistent_state` dict that survives across bars
  - State is now synced properly between `on_entry()` and `on_bar()` calls
  - Trailing stop now correctly updates and triggers at varied P&L levels

- **Webhook Holdings Lookup Fixed** (`webhook-service/dhan_client.py`)
  - Fixed field name from `totalHoldings` (non-existent) to `availableQty` (correct Dhan API field)
  - This was causing all SELL orders to fail with "Available: 0"
  - Added fallback to `totalQty` if `availableQty` not present

### ✨ **NEW FEATURES**

- **Partial Sell Support** (`webhook-service/app.py`, `webhook-service/dhan_client.py`)
  - If trigger requests more shares than available, sells all available instead of rejecting
  - Response includes `partial_sell: true` flag and `original_quantity` field
  - Message indicates "(partial: X of Y)" when applicable
  - Only rejects if security not in holdings OR 0 shares available

- **Enhanced Holdings Debug Logging** (`webhook-service/dhan_client.py`)
  - Logs number of holdings found during validation
  - When security not found, shows first 10 security IDs in holdings for debugging

### 📊 **STRATEGY UPDATES**

- **Weekly Rotation Strategy** (`strategies/weekly_rotation.py`)
  - Added ADX > 25 filter for strong trend entries
  - Removed MACD and EMA filters (simplified)
  - Trailing stop disabled by default (use_trailing_stop=False)
  - Fixed stop loss at 10% below entry

### 🔧 **TECHNICAL CHANGES**

- **Engine State Persistence** (`core/engine.py`)
  - New `persistent_state = {}` initialized before position loop
  - State merged into bar context: `state.update(persistent_state)`
  - Key values synced back after `on_bar()`: `entry_price`, `highest_high`
  - `persistent_state` cleared on position close (3 locations)
